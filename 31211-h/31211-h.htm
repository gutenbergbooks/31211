<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br />

<p>Of the part played by machines of war in
this war of machinery the wider public has
but a vague knowledge. Least of all does it
study the specialised functions of army aircraft.
Very many people show mild interest
in the daily reports of so many German
aeroplanes destroyed, so many driven down,
so many of ours missing, and enraged interest
in the reports of bomb raids on British
towns; but of aerial observation, the main
<i>raison d'etre</i> of flying at the front, they own
to nebulous ideas.</p>

<p>As an extreme case of this haziness over
matters aeronautic I will quote the lay question,
asked often and in all seriousness: "Can
an aeroplane stand still in the air?" Another
surprising point of view is illustrated
by the home-on-leave experience of a pilot
belonging to my present squadron. His
lunch companion&mdash;a charming lady&mdash;said she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>supposed he lived mostly on cold food while
in France.</p>

<p>"Oh no," replied the pilot, "it's much the
same as yours, only plainer and tougher."</p>

<p>"Then you do come down for meals," deduced
the lady. Only those who have flown
on active service can fully relish the comic
savour of a surmise that the Flying Corps
in France remain in the air all day amid all
weathers, presumably picnicking, between
flights, off sandwiches, cold chicken, pork
pies, and mineral waters.</p>

<p>These be far-fetched examples, but they
serve to emphasise a general misconception
of the conditions under which the flying
services carry out their work at the big war.
I hope that this my book, written for the
most part at odd moments during a few
months of training in England, will suggest
to civilian readers a rough impression of such
conditions. To Flying Officers who honour
me by comparing the descriptions with their
own experiences, I offer apology for whatever
they may regard as "hot air," while submitting
in excuse that the narratives are
founded on unexaggerated fact, as any one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>who served with Umpty Squadron through
the Battle of the Somme can bear witness.</p>

<p>I have expressed a hope that the chapters
and letters will suggest a rough impression
of work done by R.F.C. pilots and observers
in France. A complete impression they could
not suggest, any more than the work of a
Brigade-Major could be regarded as representative
of that of the General Staff. The
Flying-Corps-in-the-Field is an organisation
great in numbers and varied in functions.
Many separate duties are allotted to it, and
each separate squadron, according to its type
of machine, confines itself to two or three of
these tasks.</p>

<p>The book, then, deals only with the squadron
to which I belonged last year, and it does
not pretend to be descriptive of the Flying
Corps as a whole. Ours was a crack squadron
in its day, and, as General Brancker has
mentioned in his Introduction, it held a
melancholy record in the number of its losses.
Umpty's Squadron's casualties during August,
September, and October of 1916 still constitute
a record for the casualties of any one
flying squadron during any three months
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>since the war began. Once eleven of our
machines were posted as "missing" in the
space of two days&mdash;another circumstance
which has fortunately never yet been equalled
in R.F.C. history. It was a squadron that
possessed excellent pilots, excellent achievements,
and the herewith testimonial in a
letter found on a captured German airman,
with reference to the machine of which we
then had the Flying Corps monopoly: "The
most-to-be-feared of British machines is the
S&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Our duties were long reconnaissance, offensive
patrols around German air country,
occasional escort for bombing craft, and
occasional photography. I have but touched
upon other branches of army aeronautics;
though often, when we passed different types
of machine, I would compare their job to
ours and wonder if it were more pleasant.
Thousands of feet below us, for example,
were the artillery craft, which darted backward
and forward across the lines as from
their height of vantage they ranged and
registered for the guns. On push days these
same buses were to be seen lower still, well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>within range of machine-gun bullets from the
ground, as they crawled and nosed over the
line of advance and kept intelligent contact
between far-ahead attacking infantry and the
rear. Above the tangled network of enemy
defences roved the line photography machines,
which provided the Staff with accurate survey
maps of the Boche defences. Parties of
bombers headed eastward, their lower wings
laden with eggs for delivery at some factory,
aerodrome, headquarter, railway junction, or
ammunition dump. Dotted everywhere,
singly or in formations of two, three, four, or
six, were those aristocrats of the air, the
single-seater fighting scouts. These were envied
for their advantages. They were comparatively
fast, they could turn, climb, and
stunt better and quicker than any two-seater,
and their petrol-tanks held barely enough for
two hours, so that their shows were soon completed.
All these varied craft had their separate
functions, difficulties, and dangers. Two
things only were shared by all of us&mdash;dodging
Archie and striving to strafe the Air Hun.</p>

<p>Since those days flying conditions on the
Western Front have been much changed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>the whirligig of aeronautical development.
All things considered, the flying officer is
now given improved opportunities. Air
fighting has grown more intense, but the
machines in use are capable of much better
performance. The latest word in single-seater
scouts, which I am now flying, can
reach 22,000 feet with ease; and it has a
maximum climb greater by a third, and a
level speed greater by a sixth, than our best
scout of last year. The good old one-and-a-half
strutter (a fine bus of its period), on
which we used to drone our way around the
150-mile reconnaissance, has disappeared from
active service. The nerve-edging job of
long reconnaissance is now done by more
modern two-seaters, high-powered, fast, and
reliable, which can put up a fight on equal
terms with anything they are likely to meet.
The much-discussed B.E., after a three-year
innings, has been replaced for the most part
by a better-defended and more satisfactory
artillery bus. The F.E. and de Haviland
pushers have likewise become obsolete. The
scouts which we thought invincible last autumn
are badly outclassed by later types.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>For the rest, the Flying Corps in France
has grown enormously in size and importance.
The amount of work credited to
each branch of it has nearly doubled during
the past year&mdash;reconnaissance, artillery observation,
photography, bombing, contact
patrol, and, above all, fighting. Air scraps
have tended more and more to become
battles between large formations. But most
significant is the rapid increase in attacks
by low-flying aeroplanes on ground personnel
and materiel, a branch which is certain to
become an important factor in the winning
of the war.</p>

<p>And this whirlwind growth will continue.
The world at large, as distinct from the
small world of aeronautics, does not realize
that aircraft will soon become predominant
as a means of war, any more than it reckons
with the subsequent era of universal flight,
when designers, freed from the subordination
of all factors to war requirements, will
give birth to machines safe as motor-cars or
ships, and capable of carrying heavy freights
for long distances cheaply and quickly.
Speaking of an average pilot and a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>non-expert
enthusiast, I do not believe that even
our organisers of victory are yet aware of
the tremendous part which aircraft can be
made to take in the necessary humbling of
Germany.</p>

<p>Without taking into account the limitless
reserve of American aerial potentiality, it is
clear that within a year the Allies will have at
their disposal many thousands of war aeroplanes.
A proper apportionment of such of
them as can be spared for offensive purposes
could secure illimitable results. If for no other
cause it would shorten the war by its effect
on civilian nerves. We remember the hysterical
outburst of rage occasioned by the
losses consequent upon a daylight raid on
London of some fifteen machines, though the
public had become inured to the million
military casualties since 1914. What, then,
would be the effect on German war-weariness
if giant raids on fortified towns by a
hundred or so allied machines were of weekly
occurrence? And what would be the effect
on our own public if giant raids on British
towns were of weekly occurrence? Let us
make the most of our aerial chances, and so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>forestall betrayal by war-weariness, civilian
pacifism, self-centred fools, and strange
people.</p>

<p>From an army point of view the probable
outcome of an extensive aerial offensive
would be still greater. Well-organised bomb
raids on German aerodromes during the night
and early morning have several times kept
the sky clear of hostile aircraft during the
day of an important advance. If this be
achieved with our present limited number of
bombing machines, much more will be possible
when we have double or treble the
supply. Imagine the condition of a particular
sector of the advanced lines of communication
if it were bombed every day by
scores of aeroplanes. Scarcely any movement
would be possible until bad weather
made the attacks non-continuous; and few
supply dep&ocirc;ts in the chosen area would
afterwards remain serviceable. Infantry and
artillery dependent upon this district of
approach from the rear would thus be deprived
of essential supplies.</p>

<p>Apart from extensive bombing, an air
offensive of at least equal value may happen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>in the form of machine-gun attacks from
above. To-day nothing seems to panic the
Boche more than a sudden swoop by a low-flying
aeroplane, generous of bullets, as
those of us who have tried this game have
noticed. No German trench, no emplacement,
no battery position, no line of transport
is safe from the R.F.C. Vickers and
Lewis guns; and retaliation is difficult because
of the speed and erratic movement
of the attacking aeroplane. Little imagination
is necessary to realise the damage,
moral and material, which could be inflicted
on any selected part of the front if it were
constantly scoured by a few dozen of such
guerilla raiders. No movement could take
place during the daytime, and nobody could
remain in the open for longer than a few
minutes.</p>

<p>The seemingly far-fetched speculations
above are commonplace enough in the judgment
of aeronautical people of far greater
authority and experience than I can claim.
But they could only be brought to materialisation
by an abnormal supply of modern
aeroplanes, especially the chaser craft <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>necessary
to keep German machines from interference.
Given the workshop effort to
provide this supply, French and British
pilots can be relied upon to make the most
of it. I am convinced that war flying will
be organised as a means to victory; but as
my opinion is of small expert value I do not
propose to discuss how it might be done.
This much, however, I will predict. When,
in some nine months' time&mdash;if the gods
permit&mdash;a sequel to the present book appears,
dealing with this year's personal experiences
above the scene of battle, the
aerial factor will be well on the way to the
position of war predominance to which it is
destined.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="cen smcap">By Major-General W. S. BRANCKER<br />
(Deputy Director-General of Military A&euml;ronautics)</p>
<br />

<p>Every day adds something to the achievements
of aviation, brings to light yet another
of its possibilities, or discloses more
vividly its inexhaustible funds of adventure
and romance.</p>

<p>This volume, one of the first books about
fighting in the air, is written by a fighting
airman. The author depicts the daily
life of the flying officer in France, simply
and with perfect truth; indeed he describes
heroic deeds with such moderation
and absence of exaggeration that the reader
will scarcely realise that these stories are
part of the annals of a squadron which
for a time held a record in the heaviness
of its losses.</p>

<p>The importance of the aerial factor in the
prosecution of the war grows apace. The
Royal Flying Corps, from being an undependable
and weakly assistant to the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>arms, is now absolutely indispensable, and
has attained a position of almost predominant
importance. If the war goes on without
decisive success being obtained by our
armies on the earth, it seems almost inevitable
that we must depend on offensive
action in the air and from the air to bring
us victory.</p>

<p>We in London have had some slight
personal experience of what a very weak
and moderately prosecuted aerial offensive
can accomplish. With the progress of the
past three years before us, it needs little
imagination to visualise the possibilities of
such an offensive, even in one year's time;
and as each succeeding year adds to the
power of rival aerial fleets, the thought of
war will become almost impossible.</p>

<p>War has been the making of aviation;
let us hope that aviation will be the destruction
of war.</p>

<p>All units of the army have known it, the
serio-comedy of waiting for embarkation
orders.</p>

<p>After months of training the twelvetieth
battalion, battery, or squadron is almost
ready for a plunge into active service. Then
comes, from a source which cannot be trailed,
a mysterious Date. The orderly-room
whispers: "June the fifteenth"; the senior
officers' quarters murmur: "France on June
the fifteenth"; the mess echoes to the tidings
spread by the subaltern-who-knows:
"We're for it on June the fifteenth, me lad";
through the men's hutments the word is
spread: "It's good-bye to this blinking hole
on June the fifteenth"; the Home receives a
letter and confides to other homes: "Reginald's
lot are going to the war on June the
fifteenth"; finally, if we are to believe Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>William le Queux, the Military Intelligence
Department of the German Empire dockets
a report: "Das zw&ouml;lfzigste Battalion (Batterie
oder Escadrille) geht am 15 Juni nach
Frankreich."</p>

<p>June opens with an overhaul of officers
and men. Last leave is distributed, the
doctor examines everybody by batches,
backward warriors are worried until they
become expert, the sergeant-major polishes
his men on the grindstone of discipline,
the C.O. indents for a draft to complete
establishment, an inspection is held by an
awesome general. Except for the mobilisation
stores everything is complete by June
10.</p>

<p>But there is still no sign of the wanted
stores on the Date, and June 16 finds the
unit still in the same blinking hole, wherever
that may be. The days drag on, and Date
the second is placed on a pedestal.</p>

<p>"Many thanks for an extra fortnight in
England," says the subaltern-who-knows;
"we're not going till June the twenty-seventh."</p>

<p>The adjutant, light duty, is replaced by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>an adjutant, general service. Mobilisation
stores begin to trickle into the quartermaster's
reservoir. But on June 27 the
stores are far from ready, and July 6 is
miraged as the next Date. This time it
looks like business. The war equipment is
completed, except for the identity discs.</p>

<p>On July 4 a large detachment departs,
after twelve hours' notice, to replace casualties
in France. Those remaining in the
now incomplete unit grow wearily sarcastic.
More last leave is granted. The camp is
given over to rumour. An orderly, delivering
a message to the C.O. (formerly stationed
in India) at the latter's quarters, notes a
light cotton tunic and two sun-helmets. Sun-helmets?
Ah, somewhere East, of course.
The men tell each other forthwith that their
destination has been changed to Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>A band of strangers report in place of the
draft that went to France, and in them the
N.C.O.'s plant <i>esprit de corps</i> and the fear of
God. The missing identity discs arrive, and
a fourth Date is fixed&mdash;July 21. And the
dwellers in the blinking hole, having been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>wolfed several times, are sceptical, and treat
the latest report as a bad joke.</p>

<p>"My dear man," remarks the subaltern-who-knows,
"it's only some more hot air. I
never believed in the other dates, and I don't
believe in this. If there's one day of the
three hundred and sixty-five when we shan't
go, it's July the twenty-first."</p>

<p>And at dawn on July 21 the battalion,
battery, or squadron moves unobtrusively to
a port of embarkation for France.</p>

<p>Whereas in most branches of the army
the foundation of this scaffolding of postponement
is indistinct except to the second-sighted
Staff, in the case of the Flying Corps
it is definitely based on that uncertain quantity,
the supply of aeroplanes. The organisation
of personnel is not a difficult task, for
all are highly trained beforehand. The pilots
have passed their tests and been decorated
with wings, and the mechanics have already
learned their separate trades as riggers, fitters,
carpenters, sailmakers, and the like. The
only training necessary for the pilot is to fly
as often as possible on the type of bus he
will use in France, and to benefit by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>experience of the flight-commanders, who as
a rule have spent a hundred or two hours
over Archie and the enemy lines. As regards
the mechanics, the quality of their
skilled work is tempered by the technical
sergeant-major, who knows most things about
an aeroplane, and the quality of their behaviour
by the disciplinary sergeant-major,
usually an ex-regular with a lively talent for
blasting.</p>

<p>The machines comprise a less straight-forward
problem. The new service squadron
is probably formed to fly a recently adopted
type of aeroplane, of which the early production
in quantities is hounded by difficulty.
The engine and its parts, the various sections
of the machine itself, the guns, the
synchronising gear, all these are made in
separate factories, after standardisation, and
must then be co-ordinated before the craft
is ready for its test. If the output of any
one part fall below what was expected, the
whole is kept waiting; and invariably the
quantity or quality of output is at first
below expectation in some particular. Adding
to the delays of supply others due to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>the more urgent claims of squadrons at the
front for machines to replace those lost or
damaged, it can easily be seen that a new
squadron will have a succession of Dates.</p>

<p>Even when the machines are ready, and
the transport leaves with stores, ground-officers,
and mechanics, the period of postponement
is not ended. All being well, the
pilots will fly their craft to France on the
day after their kit departs with the transport.
But the day after produces impossible
weather, as do the five or six days that follow.
One takes advantage of each of these
set-backs to pay a further farewell visit to
one's dearest or nearest, according to where
the squadron is stationed, until at the last
the dearest or nearest says: "Good-bye. I
do hope you'll have a safe trip to France
to-morrow morning. You'll come and see
me again to-morrow evening, won't you?"</p>

<p>At last a fine morning breaks the spell of
dud weather, and the pilots fly away; but
lucky indeed is the squadron that reaches
France without delivering over part of its
possessions to that aerial highwayman the
forced landing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>It was at an aerodrome forty minutes
distant from London that we patiently
waited for flying orders. Less than the
average delay was expected, for two flights
of the squadron were already on the Somme,
and we of the third flight were to join them
immediately we received our full complement
of war machines. These, in those days,
were to be the latest word in fighting two-seaters
of the period. Two practice buses
had been allotted to us, and on them the
pilots were set to perform landings, split-"air"
turns, and stunts likely to be useful
in a scrap. For the rest, we sorted ourselves
out, which pilot was to fly with which observer,
and improved the machines' accessories.</p>

<p>An inspiration suggested to the flight-commander,
who although an ex-Civil
Servant was a man of resource, that mirrors
of polished steel, as used on the handlebars
of motor-cycles, to give warning of
roadcraft at the rear, might be valuable in
an aeroplane. Forthwith he screwed one to
the sloping half-strut of his top center-section.
The trial was a great success, and we
bought six such mirrors, an investment which
was to pay big dividends in many an air flight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Next the flight-commander made up his
mind to bridge the chasm of difficult communication
between pilot and observer. Formerly,
in two-seaters with the pilot's seat in
front, a message could only be delivered on
a slip of paper or by shutting off the engine,
so that one's voice could be heard; the loss of
time in each case being ill afforded when
Huns were near. An experiment with a
wide speaking-tube, similar to those through
which a waiter in a Soho restaurant demands
<i>c&ocirc;telettes milan&egrave;ses</i> from an underground
kitchen, had proved that the engine's roar
was too loud for distinct transmission by
this means. We made a mouthpiece and a
sound-box earpiece, and tried them on tubes
of every make and thickness; but whenever
the engine was at work the words sounded
indistinct as words sung in English Opera.
One day a speedometer behaved badly, and
a mechanic was connecting a new length of
the rubber pitot-tubing along which the air
is sucked from a wingtip to operate the
instrument. Struck with an idea, the pilot
fitted mouthpiece and earpiece to a stray
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>piece of the tubing, and took to the air with
his observer. The pair conversed easily and
pleasantly all the way to 10,000 feet. The
problem was solved, and ever afterwards
pilot and observer were able to warn and
curse each other in mid-air without waste of
time. The high-powered two-seaters of
to-day are supplied with excellent speaking-tubes
before they leave the factories; but
we, who were the first to use a successful
device of this kind on active service, owed
its introduction to a chance idea.</p>

<p>One by one our six war machines arrived
and were allotted to their respective pilots.
Each man treated his bus as if it were an
only child. If another pilot were detailed
to fly it the owner would watch the performance
jealously, and lurid indeed was the
subsequent talk if an outsider choked the
carburettor, taxied the bus on the switch, or
otherwise did something likely to reduce the
efficiency of engine or aeroplane. On the
whole, however, the period of waiting was
dull, so that we welcomed comic relief provided
by the affair of the Jabberwocks.</p>

<p>The first three machines delivered from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>the Rafborough dep&ocirc;t disappointed us in
one particular. The movable mounting for
the observer's gun in the rear cockpit was a
weird contraption like a giant catapult. It
occupied a great deal of room, was stiff-moving,
reduced the speed by about five
miles an hour owing to head resistance,
refused to be slewed round sideways for
sighting at an angle, and constantly collided
with the observer's head. We called it the
Christmas Tree, the Heath Robinson, the
Jabberwock, the Ruddy Limit, and names
unprintable. The next three buses were
fitted with Scarff mountings, which were as
satisfactory as the Jabberwocks were unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Then, late in the evening, one of the new
craft was crashed beyond repair. At early
dawn a pilot and his observer left their beds,
walked through the rain to the aerodrome,
and sneaked to the flight shed. They returned
two hours later, hungry, dirty, and
flushed with suppressed joy. After breakfast
we found that the crashed bus had lost
a Scarff mounting, and the bus manned by
the early risers had found one. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>gargoyle
shape of a discarded Jabberwock
sprawled on the floor.</p>

<p>At lunch-time another pilot disappeared
with his observer and an air of determination.
When the shed was opened for the
afternoon's work the Jabberwock had been
replaced on the machine of the early risers,
and the commandeered Scarff was affixed
neatly to the machine of the quick-lunchers.
While the two couples slanged each other a
third pilot and observer sought out the flight-commander,
and explained why they were
entitled to the disputed mounting. The
pilot, the observer pointed out, was the
senior pilot of the three; the observer, the
pilot pointed out, was the senior observer.
Was it not right, therefore, that they should
be given preferential treatment? The flight-commander
agreed, and by the time the
early-risers and quick-lunchers had settled
their quarrel by the spin of a coin, the Scarff
had found a fourth and permanent home.</p>

<p>The two remaining Jabberwocks became
an obsession with their unwilling owners,
who hinted darkly at mutiny when told that
no more Scarffs could be obtained, the Naval
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Air Service having contracted for all the
new ones in existence. But chance, in the
form of a Big Bug's visit of inspection,
opened the way for a last effort. In the
machine examined by the Big Bug, an exhausted
observer was making frantic efforts
to swivel an archaic framework from back
to front. The Big Bug looked puzzled, but
passed on without comment. As he approached
the next machine a second observer
tried desperately to move a similar
monstrosity round its hinges, while the pilot,
stop-watch in hand, looked on with evident
sorrow. The Big Bug now decided to investigate,
and he demanded the reason for
the stop-watch and the hard labour.</p>

<p>"We've just timed this mounting, sir, to
see how quickly it could be moved for firing
at a Hun. I find it travels at the rate of
6.5 inches a minute."</p>

<p>"Disgraceful," said the Big Bug. "We'll
get them replaced by the new type." And
get them replaced he did, the R.N.A.S. contract
notwithstanding. The four conspirators
have since believed themselves to be
heaven-born strategists.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Followed the average number of delays
due to crashed aeroplanes and late stores.
At length, however, the transport moved
away with our equipment, and we received
orders to proceed by air a day later. But
next day brought a steady drizzle, which
continued for some forty-eight hours, so that
instead of proceeding by air the kitless officers
bought clean collars. Then came two
days of low, clinging mist, and the purchase
of shirts. A fine morning on the fifth day
forestalled the necessity of new pyjamas.</p>

<p>At ten of the clock we were in our machines,
saying good-bye to a band of lucky
pilots who stayed at home to strafe the
Zeppelin and be petted in the picture press
and the Piccadilly grillroom. "Contaxer!"
called a mechanic, facing the flight-commander's
propeller. "Contact!" replied the flight-commander;
his engine roared, around flew
the propeller, the chocks were pulled clear,
and away and up raced the machine. The
rest followed and took up their appointed
places behind the leader, at a height chosen
for the rendezvous.</p>

<p>We headed in a south-easterly direction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>passing on our left the ragged fringe of
London. At this point the formation was
not so good as it might have been, probably
because we were taking leave of the
Thames and other landmarks. But four of
the twelve who comprised the party have
since seen them, and of these four one was
to return by way of a German hospital, a
prison camp, a jump from the footboard of
a train, a series of lone night-walks that
extended over two months, and an escape
across the frontier of Neutralia, while two fellow-fugitives
were shot dead by Boche sentries.</p>

<p>Above the junction of Redhill the leader
veered to the left and steered by railway to
the coast. Each pilot paid close attention
to his place in the group, for this was to be
a test of whether our formation flying was
up to the standard necessary for work over
enemy country. To keep exact formation is
far from easy for the novice who has to deal
with the vagaries of a rotary engine in a
machine sensitive on the controls. The engine
develops a sudden increase of revolutions,
and the pilot finds himself overhauling
the craft in front; he throttles back and finds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>himself being overhauled by the craft behind;
a slight deviation from the course and
the craft all around seem to be swinging
sideways or upwards. Not till a pilot can
fly his bus unconsciously does he keep place
without repeated reference to the throttle
and instrument-board.</p>

<p>Beyond Redhill we met an unwieldy
cloudbank and were forced to lose height.
The clouds became denser and lower, and
the formation continued to descend, so that
when the coast came into view we were
below 3000 feet.</p>

<p>A more serious complication happened
near Dovstone, the port which was to be
our cross-Channel springboard. There we
ran into a mist, thick as a London fog.
It covered the Channel like a blanket, and
completely enveloped Dovstone and district.
To cross under these conditions would have
been absurd, for opaque vapour isolated us
from the ground and cut the chain of vision
which had bound together the six machines.
We dropped through the pall of
mist and trusted to Providence to save us
from collision.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Four fortunate buses emerged directly
above Dovstone aerodrome, where they
landed. The other two, in one of which I
was a passenger, came out a hundred feet
over the cliffs. We turned inland, and soon
found ourselves travelling over a wilderness
of roofs and chimneys. A church-tower
loomed ahead, so we climbed back into the
mist. Next we all but crashed into the
hill south of Dovstone. We banked steeply
and swerved to the right, just as the slope
seemed rushing towards us through the haze.</p>

<p>Once more we descended into the clear
air. Down below was a large field, and in
the middle of it was an aeroplane. Supposing
this to be the aerodrome, we landed,
only to find ourselves in an uneven meadow,
containing, besides the aeroplane already
mentioned, one cow, one pond, and some
Brass Hats.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As the second bus was taxiing
over the grass the pilot jerked it round
sharply to avoid the pond. His undercarriage
gave, the propeller hit the earth
and smashed itself, and the machine heeled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>over and pulled up dead, with one wing
leaning on the ground.</p>

<p>Marmaduke, our war baby, was the pilot
of the maimed machine. He is distinctly
young, but he can on occasion declaim impassioned
language in a manner that would
be creditable to the most liver-ridden major
in the Indian Army. The Brass Hats
seemed mildly surprised when, after inspecting
the damage, Marmaduke danced
around the unfortunate bus and cursed systematically
persons and things so diverse as
the thingumy fool whose machine had misled
us into landing, the thingumy pond, the
thingumy weather expert who ought to have
warned us of the thingumy Channel mist,
the Kaiser, his aunt, and his contemptible
self.</p>

<p>He was no what-you-may-call-it good as a
pilot, shouted Marmaduke to the ruminative
cow, and he intended to leave the blank
R.F.C. for the Blanky Army Service Corps
or the blankety Grave-diggers Corps. As a
last resort, he would get a job as a double-blank
Cabinet Minister, being no blank-blank
good for anything else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>The Brass Hats gazed and gazed and
gazed. A heavy silence followed Marmaduke's
outburst, a silence pregnant with
possibilities of Staff displeasure, of summary
arrest, of&mdash;laughter. Laughter won.
The Brass Hats belonged to the staff of
an Anzadian division in the neighbourhood,
and one of them, a young-looking major
with pink riding breeches and a prairie accent,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, some beautiful birds, some
beautiful swear, and, by Abraham's trousers,
some beautiful angel boy."</p>

<p>Marmaduke wiped the foam from his
mouth and apologised.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Brass Hat from
one of our great Dominions of Empire, "I
do it every day myself, before breakfast
generally."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the news of our arrival had
rippled the calm surface of the daily round
at Dovstone. Obviously, said the good people
to each other, the presence of three
aeroplanes in a lonely field, with a guard
of Anzadians around the said field, must
have some hidden meaning. Perhaps there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>had been a German air raid under cover of
the mist. Perhaps a German machine had
been brought down. Within half an hour of
our erratic landing a dozen people in Dovstone
swore to having seen a German aeroplane
touch earth in our field. The pilot
had been made prisoner by Anzadians, added
the dozen eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>Such an event clearly called for investigation
by Dovstone's detective intellects.
We were honoured by a visit from two
special constables, looking rather like the
Bing Boys. Their collective eagle eye
grasped the situation in less than a second.
I happened to be standing in the centre of
the group, still clad in flying kit. The Bing
Boys decided that I was their prey, and one
of them advanced, flourishing a note-book.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said he to a Brass Hat,
"I represent the civil authority. Will you
please tell me if this"&mdash;pointing to me&mdash;"is
the captive baby-killer?"</p>

<p>"Now give us the chorus, old son," said
Marmaduke. Explanations followed, and the
Bing Boys retired, rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>It is embarrassing enough to be mistaken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>for a German airman. It is more embarrassing
to be mistaken for an airman who
shot down a German airman when there was
no German airman to shoot down. Such
was the fate of the four of us&mdash;two pilots
and two observers&mdash;when we left our field to
the cow and the conference of Brass Hats,
and drove to the Grand Hotel. The taxi-driver,
who, from his enthusiastic civility,
had clearly never driven a cab in London,
would not be convinced.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, when we arrived at
the hotel, "I'm proud to have driven you,
and I don't want your money. No, sir, I
know you avi-yaters are modest and aren't
allowed to say what you've done. Good day,
gentlemen, and good luck, gentlemen."</p>

<p>It was the same in the Grand Hotel.
Porters and waiters asked what had become
of "the Hun," and no denial could fully
convince them. At a tango tea held in the
hotel that afternoon we were pointed out as
the intrepid birdmen who had done the deed
of the day. Flappers and fluff-girls further
embarrassed us with interested glances, and
one of them asked for autographs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Marmaduke rose to the occasion. He
smiled, produced a gold-tipped fountain-pen,
and wrote with a flourish, "John James
Christopher Benjamin Brown. Greetings
from Dovstone."</p>

<p>But Marmaduke the volatile was doomed
to suffer a loss of dignity. He had neglected
to bring an emergency cap, which an airman
on a cross-country flight should never
forget. Bareheaded he accompanied us to a
hatter's. Here the R.F.C. caps of the
"stream-lined" variety had all been sold, so
the war baby was obliged to buy a general
service hat. The only one that fitted him
was shapeless as a Hausfrau, ponderous as a
Bishop, unstable as a politician, grotesque as
a Birthday Honours' List. It was a nice
quiet hat, we assured Marmaduke&mdash;just the
thing for active service. Did it suit him?
Very well indeed, we replied&mdash;made him look
like Lord Haldane at the age of sixteen.
Marmaduke bought it.</p>

<p>The monstrosity brought us a deal of attention
in the streets, but this Marmaduke
put down to his fame as a conqueror of
phantom raiders. He began, however, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>suspect that something was wrong when a
newsboy shouted, "Where jer get that 'at,
leftenant?" The question was unoriginal and
obvious; but the newsboy showed imagination
at his second effort, which was the opening
line of an old music-hall chorus: "Sidney's
'olidays er in Septembah!" Marmaduke
called at another shop and chose the stiffest
hat he could find.</p>

<p>By next morning the mist had cleared, and
we flew across the Channel, under a curtain
of clouds, leaving Marmaduke to fetch a new
machine. When you visit the Continent
after the war, friend the reader, travel by
the Franco-British service of aerial transport,
which will come into being with the return
of peace. You will find it more comfortable
and less tiring; and if you have a weak
stomach you will find it less exacting, for
none but the very nervous are ill in an aeroplane,
if the pilot behaves himself. Also,
you will complete the journey in a quarter
of the time taken by boat. Within fifteen
minutes of our departure from Dovstone we
were in French air country. A few ships
specked the sea-surface, which reflected a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>dull grey from the clouds, but otherwise the
crossing was monotonous.</p>

<p>We passed up the coast-line as far as the
bend at Cape Grisnez, and so to Calais.
Beyond this town were two sets of canals,
one leading south and the other east. Follow
the southern group and you will find
our immediate destination, the aircraft dep&ocirc;t
at Saint Gregoire. Follow the eastern group
and they will take you to the Boche aircraft
dep&ocirc;t at Lille. Thus were we reminded that
tango teas and special constables belonged to
the past.</p>

<p>The covey landed at Saint Gregoire without
mishap, except for a bent axle and a
torn tyre. With these replaced, and the
supplies of petrol and oil replenished, we
flew south during the afternoon to the river-basin
of war. Marmaduke arrived five days
later, in time to take part in our first patrol
over the lines. On this trip his engine was put
out of action by a stray fragment from anti-aircraft.
After gliding across the trenches, he
landed among some dug-outs inhabited by
sappers, and made use of much the same
vocabulary as when he crashed at Dovstone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Marmaduke shot down several Hun machines
during the weeks that followed, but on
the very day of his posting for a decoration a
Blighty bullet gave him a return ticket to England
and a mention in the casualty list. When
last I heard of him he was at Dovstone aerodrome,
teaching his elders how to fly. I can
guess what he would do if at the Grand Hotel
there some chance-introduced collector of autographs
offered her book. He would think
of the cow and the Brass Hats, smile, produce
his gold-tipped fountain-pen, and write
with a flourish, "John James Christopher
Benjamin Brown. Greetings from Dovstone."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h2>THE DAY'S WORK.</h2>
<br />

<p>For weeks we had talked guardedly of "it"
and "them"&mdash;of the greatest day of the
Push and the latest form of warfare. Details
of the twin mysteries had been rightly
kept secret by the red-hatted Olympians
who really knew, though we of the fighting
branches had heard sufficient to stimulate an
appetite for rumour and exaggeration. Consequently
we possessed our souls in impatience
and dabbled in conjecture.</p>

<p>Small forts moving on the caterpillar system
of traction used for heavy guns were to
crawl across No Man's Land, enfilade the
enemy front line with quick-firing and machine
guns, and hurl bombs on such of the
works and emplacements as they did not
ram to pieces,&mdash;thus a confidential adjutant,
who seemed to think he had admitted me
into the inner circle of knowledge tenanted
only by himself and the G.S.O. people (I.,
II., and III., besides untabbed nondescripts).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Veterans gave tips on war in the open country,
or chatted airily about another tour of
such places as Le Catelet, Le Cateau, Mons,
the Maubeuge district, and Namur. The
cautious listened in silence, and distilled only
two facts from the dubious mixture of fancy.
The first was that we were booked for a big
advance one of these fine days; and the
second that new armoured cars, caterpillared
and powerfully armed, would make their
bow to Brother Boche.</p>

<p>The balloon of swollen conjecture floated
over the back of the Front until it was destroyed
by the quick-fire of authentic orders,
which necessarily revealed much of the plan
and many of the methods. On the afternoon
of September 14 all the officers of our
aerodrome were summoned to an empty shed.
There we found our own particular General,
who said more to the point in five minutes
than the rumourists had said in five weeks.
There was to be a grand attack next morning.
The immediate objectives were not distant,
but their gain would be of enormous value.
Every atom of energy must be concentrated
on the task. It was hoped that an element
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>of surprise would be on our side, helped by a
new engine of war christened the Tank. The
nature of this strange animal, male and female,
was then explained.</p>

<p>Next came an exposition of the part allotted
to the Flying Corps. No German
machines could be allowed near enough to
the lines for any observation. We must
shoot all Hun machines at sight and give
them no rest. Our bombers should make
life a burden on the enemy lines of communication.
Infantry and transport were to
be worried, whenever possible, by machine-gun
fire from above. Machines would be
detailed for contact work with our infantry.
Reconnaissance jobs were to be completed at
all costs, if there seemed the slightest chance
of bringing back useful information.</p>

<p>No more bubbles of hot air were blown
around the mess table. Only the evening
was between us and the day of days. The
time before dinner was filled by the testing
of machines and the writing of those cheerful,
non-committal letters that precede big
happenings at the front. Our flight had
visitors to dinner, but the shadow of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>to-morrow
was too insistent for the racket
customary on a guest night. It was as if
the electricity had been withdrawn from the
atmosphere and condensed for use when required.
The dinner talk was curiously restrained.
The usual shop chatter prevailed,
leavened by snatches of bantering cynicism
from those infants of the world who thought
that to be a beau sabreur of the air one
must juggle verbally with life, death, and
Archie shells. Even these war babies (three
of them died very gallantly before we reassembled
for breakfast next day) had
bottled most of their exuberance. Understanding
silences were sandwiched between
yarns. A wag searched for the Pagliacci
record, and set the gramophone to churn
out "Vesti la Giubba." The guests stayed
to listen politely to a few revue melodies,
and then slipped away. The rest turned in
immediately, in view of the jobs at early
dawn.</p>

<p>"Night, everybody," said one of the flight-commanders.
"Meet you at Mossy-Face in
the morning!"</p>

<p>In the morning some of us saw him spin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>earthwards over Mossy-Face Wood, surrounded
by Hun machines.</p>

<p>Long before the dawn of September 15, I
awoke to the roar of engines, followed by
an overhead drone as a party of bombers
circled round until they were ready to start.
When this noise had died away, the dull
boom of an intense bombardment was able
to make itself heard. I rolled over and went
to sleep again, for our own show was not
due to start until three hours later.</p>

<p>The Flying Corps programme on the great
day was a marvel of organisation. The jobs
fitted into one another, and into the general
tactical scheme of the advance, as exactly as
the parts of a flawless motor. At no time
could enemy craft steal toward the lines to
spy out the land. Every sector was covered
by defensive patrols which travelled northward
and southward, southward and northward,
eager to pounce on any black-crossed
stranger. Offensive patrols moved and
fought over Boche territory until they were
relieved by other offensive patrols. The machines
on artillery observation were thus worried
only by Archie, and the reconnaissance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>formations were able to do their work with
little interruption, except when they passed
well outside the patrol areas. Throughout
the day those guerillas of the air, the bombing
craft, went across and dropped eggs on
anything between general headquarters and a
railway line. The corps buses kept constant
communication between attacking battalions
and the rear. A machine first reported the
exploit of the immortal Tank that waddled
down High Street, Flers, spitting bullets and
inspiring sick fear. And there were many
free-lance stunts, such as Lewis gun attacks
on reserve troops or on trains.</p>

<p>The three squadrons attached to our aerodrome
had to the day's credit two long
reconnaissances, three offensive patrols, and
four bomb raids. Six Hun machines were
destroyed on these shows, and the bombers
did magnificent work at vital points. At 2
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> they dropped eggs on the German
Somme headquarters. An hour later they
deranged the railway station of a large garrison
town. For the remaining time before
sunset they were not so busy. They merely
destroyed an ammunition train, cut two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>railway
lines, damaged an important railhead,
and sprayed a bivouac ground.</p>

<p>An orderly called me at 4.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> for the
big offensive patrol. The sky was a dark-grey
curtain decorated by faintly twinkling
stars. I dressed to the thunderous accompaniment
of the guns, warmed myself with
a cup of hot cocoa, donned flying kit, and
hurried to the aerodrome. There we gathered
around C., the patrol leader, who gave
us final instructions about the method of
attack. We tested our guns and climbed
into the machines.</p>

<p>By now the east had turned to a light
grey with pink smudges from the forefinger
of sunrise. Punctually at five o'clock the
order, "Start up!" passed down the long
line of machines. The flight-commander's
engine began a loud metallic roar, then
softened as it was throttled down. The
pilot waved his hand, the chocks were pulled
from under the wheels, and the machine
moved forward. The throttle was again
opened full out as the bus raced into the
wind until flying speed had been attained,
when it skimmed gently from the ground.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>We followed, and carried out the rendezvous
at 3000 feet.</p>

<p>The morning light increased every minute,
and the grey of the sky was merging into
blue. The faint, hovering ground-mist was
not sufficient to screen our landmarks. The
country below was a shadowy patchwork of
coloured pieces. The woods, fantastic shapes
of dark green, stood out strongly from the
mosaic of brown and green fields. The pattern
was divided and subdivided by the
straight, poplar-bordered roads peculiar to
France.</p>

<p>We passed on to the dirty strip of wilderness
which is the actual front. The battered
villages and disorderly ruins looked like hieroglyphics
traced on wet sand. A sea of
smoke rolled over the ground for miles. It
was a by-product of one of the most terrific
bombardments in the history of trench warfare.
Through it hundreds of gun-flashes
twinkled, like the lights of a Chinese garden.</p>

<p>Having reached a height of 12,000 feet, we
crossed the trenches south of Bapaume. As
the danger that stray bullets might fall on
friends no longer existed, pilots and observers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>fired a few rounds into space to make sure
their guns were behaving properly.</p>

<p>Archie began his frightfulness early. He
concentrated on the leader's machine, but
the still-dim light spoiled his aim, and many
of the bursts were dotted between the craft
behind. I heard the customary <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i>
<i>wouff!</i> followed in one case by the <i>hs-s-s-s-s</i>
of passing fragments. We swerved and
dodged to disconcert the gunners. After five
minutes of hide-and-seek, we shook off this
group of Archie batteries.</p>

<p>The flight-commander headed for Mossy-Face
Wood, scene of many air battles and
bomb raids. An aerodrome just east of the
wood was the home of the Fokker star,
Boelcke. C. led us to it, for it was his great
ambition to account for Germany's best
pilot.</p>

<p>While we approached, I looked down and
saw eight machines with black Maltese
crosses on their planes, about three thousand
feet below. They had clipped wings of a
peculiar whiteness, and they were ranged one
above the other, like the rungs of a Venetian
blind. A cluster of small scouts swooped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>down from Heaven-knows-what height and
hovered above us; but C. evidently did not
see them, for he dived steeply on the Huns
underneath, accompanied by the two machines
nearest him. The other group of
enemies then dived.</p>

<p>I looked up and saw a narrow biplane,
apparently a Roland, rushing towards our
bus. My pilot turned vertically and then
side-slipped to disconcert the Boche's aim.
The black-crossed craft swept over at a distance
of less than a hundred yards. I raised
my gun-mounting, sighted, and pressed the
trigger. Three shots rattled off&mdash;and my
Lewis gun ceased fire.</p>

<p>Intensely annoyed at being cheated out of
such a splendid target, I applied immediate
action, pulled back the cocking-handle and
pressed the trigger again. Nothing happened.
After one more immediate action
test, I examined the gun and found that an
incoming cartridge and an empty case were
jammed together in the breech. To remedy
the stoppage, I had to remove spade-grip
and body cover. As I did this, I heard an
ominous <i>ta-ta-ta-ta-ta</i> from the returning <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>German
scout. My pilot cart-wheeled round
and made for the Hun, his gun spitting continuously
through the propeller. The two
machines raced at each other until less than
fifty yards separated them. Then the Boche
swayed, turned aside, and put his nose down.
We dropped after him, with our front
machine-gun still speaking. The Roland's
glide merged into a dive, and we imitated
him. Suddenly a streak of flame came from
his petrol tank, and the next second he was
rushing earthwards, with two streamers of
smoke trailing behind.</p>

<p>I was unable to see the end of this vertical
dive, for two more single-seaters were upon
us. They plugged away while I remedied
the stoppage, and several bullets ventilated
the fuselage quite close to my cockpit. When
my gun was itself again, I changed the drum
of ammunition, and hastened to fire at the
nearest Hun. He was evidently unprepared,
for he turned and moved across our tail. As
he did so, I raked his bus from stem to stern.
I looked at him hopefully, for the range was
very short, and I expected to see him drop
towards the ground at several miles a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>minute.
He sailed on serenely. This is an annoying
habit of enemy machines when one
is sure that, by the rules of the game, they
ought to be destroyed. The machine in
question was probably hit, however, for it
did not return, and I saw it begin a glide as
though the pilot meant to land. We switched
our attention to the remaining Hun, but this
one was not anxious to fight alone. He dived
a few hundred feet, with tail well up, looking
for all the world like a trout when it drops
back into water. Afterwards he flattened
out and went east.</p>

<p>During the fight we had become separated
from the remainder of our party. I searched
all round the compass, but could find neither
friend nor foe. We returned to the aerodrome
where hostile craft were first sighted.
There was no sign of C.'s machine or of the
others who dived on the first group of Huns.
Several German machines were at rest in the
aerodrome.</p>

<p>Finding ourselves alone, we passed on towards
the lines. I twisted my neck in every
direction, for over enemy country only a
constant look out above, below, and on all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sides can save a machine from a surprise
attack. After a few minutes, we spotted six
craft bearing towards us from a great height.
Through field-glasses I was able to see their
black crosses, and I fingered my machine-gun
expectantly.</p>

<p>The strangers dived in two lots of three.
I waited until the first three were within
300 yards' range and opened fire. One of
them swerved away, but the other two passed
right under us. Something sang to the right,
and I found that part of a landing-wire was
dangling helplessly from its socket. We
thanked whatever gods there be that it was
not a flying-wire, and turned to meet the next
three Huns. We swerved violently, and they
pulled out of their dive well away from us.
With nose down and engine full out, we
raced towards the lines and safety. Three of
the attackers were unable to keep up with
us and we left them behind.</p>

<p>The other three Germans, classed by my
pilot as Halberstadts, had a great deal more
speed than ours. They did not attack at
close quarters immediately, but flew 200 to
300 yards behind, ready to pounce at their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>own moment. Two of them got between my
gun and our tail-plane, so that they were
safe from my fire. The third was slightly
above our height, and for his benefit I stood
up and rattled through a whole ammunition-drum.
Here let me say I do not think I
hit him, for he was not in difficulties. He
dived below us to join his companions, possibly
because he did not like being under
fire when they were not. To my surprise
and joy, he fell slick on one of the other two
Hun machines. This latter broke into two
pieces, which fell like stones. The machine
responsible for my luck side-slipped, spun a
little, recovered, and went down to land.
The third made off east.</p>

<p>In plain print and at a normal time, this
episode shows little that is comic. But when
it happened I was in a state of high tension,
and this, combined with the startling realisation
that a Hun pilot had saved me and destroyed
his friend, seemed irresistibly comic.
I cackled with laughter and was annoyed because
my pilot did not see the joke.</p>

<p>We reached the lines without further trouble
from anything but Archie. The pink
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>streaks of daybreak had now disappeared
beneath the whole body of the sunrise, and
the sky was of that intense blue which is the
secret of France. What was left of the
ground-mist shimmered as it congealed in
the sunlight. The pall of smoke from the
guns had doubled in volume. The Ancre
sparkled brightly.</p>

<p>We cruised around in a search for others
of our party, but found none. A defensive
patrol was operating between Albert and the
trenches. We joined it for half an hour, at
the end of which I heard a "Halloa!" from
the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>"What's up now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Going to have a look at the war," was
the pilot's reply.</p>

<p>Before I grasped his meaning he had shut
off the engine and we were gliding towards
the trenches. At 1200 feet we switched on,
flattened out, and looked for movement below.
There was no infantry advance at the
moment, but below Courcelette what seemed
to be two ungainly masses of black slime
were slithering over the ground. I rubbed
my eyes and looked again. One of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>actually crawled among the scrap-heaps that
fringed the ruins of the village. Only then
did the thought that they might be Tanks
suggest itself. Afterwards I discovered that
this was so.</p>

<p>The machine rocked violently as a projectile
hurtled by underneath us. The pilot
remembered the broken landing-wire and
steered for home. After landing, we compared
notes with others who had returned
from the expedition. C., we learned, was
down at last, after seventeen months of
flying on active service, with only one break
for any appreciable time. He destroyed one
more enemy before the Boches got him. In
the dive he got right ahead of the two machines
that followed him. As these hurried
to his assistance, they saw an enemy plane
turn over, show a white, gleaming belly, and
drop in zig-zags. C.'s bus was then seen to
heel over into a vertical dive and to plunge
down, spinning rhythmically on its axis.
Probably he was shot dead and fell over on
to the joystick, which put the machine to its
last dive. The petrol tank of the second
machine to arrive among the Huns was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>plugged by a bullet, and the pilot was forced
to land. Weeks later, his observer wrote us
a letter from a prison camp in Hanover. The
third bus, perforated by scores of bullet-holes,
got back to tell the tale.</p>

<p>C. was one of the greatest pilots produced
by the war. He was utterly fearless,
and had more time over the German
lines to his credit than any one else in the
Flying Corps. It was part of his fatalistic
creed that Archie should never be dodged,
and he would go calmly ahead when the
A.-A. guns were at their best. Somehow,
the bursts never found him. He had won
both the D.S.O. and the M.C. for deeds in
the air. Only the evening before, when
asked lightly if he was out for a V.C., he said
he would rather get Boelcke than the V.C.;
and in the end Boelcke probably got him,
for he fell over the famous German pilot's
aerodrome, and that day the German wireless
announced that Boelcke had shot down
two more machines. Peace to the ashes of a
fine pilot and a very brave man!</p>

<p>Two observers, other than C.'s passenger,
had been killed during our patrol. One of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>them was "Uncle," a captain in the Northumberland
Fusiliers. A bullet entered the
large artery of his thigh. He bled profusely
and lost consciousness in the middle of a
fight with two Huns. When he came to, a
few minutes later, he grabbed his gun and
opened fire on an enemy. After about forty
shots the chatter of the gun ceased, and
through the speaking-tube a faint voice told
the pilot to look round. The pilot did so, and
saw a Maltese-cross biplane falling in flames.
But Uncle had faded into unconsciousness
again, and he never came back. It is more
than possible that if he had put a tourniquet
round his thigh, instead of continuing the
fight, he might have lived.</p>

<p>A great death, you say? One of many
such. Only the day before I had helped
to lift the limp body of Paddy from the floor
of an observer's cockpit. He had been shot
over the heart. He fainted, recovered his
senses for ten minutes, and kept two Huns
at bay until he died, by which time the
trenches were reached.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself under fire in an aeroplane
at 10,000 feet. Imagine that only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>second ago you were in the country of shadows.
Imagine yourself feeling giddy and
deadly sick from loss of blood. Imagine
what is left of your consciousness to be
stabbed insistently by a throbbing pain.
Now imagine how you would force yourself
in this condition to grasp a machine-gun in
your numbed hand, pull back the cocking-handle,
take careful aim at a fast machine,
allowing for deflection, and fire until you
sink into death. Some day I hope to be
allowed to visit Valhalla for half an hour,
that I may congratulate Paddy and Uncle.</p>

<p>We refreshed ourselves with cold baths
and hot breakfast. In the mess the fights
were reconstructed. Sudden silences were
frequent&mdash;an unspoken tribute to C. and the
other casualties. But at lunch-time we were
cheered by the news that the first and second
objectives had been reached, that Martinpuich,
Courcelette, and Flers had fallen,
and that the Tanks had behaved well.</p>

<p>After lunch I rested awhile before the long
reconnaissance, due to start at three. Six
machines were detailed for this job; though
a faulty engine kept one of them on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ground. The observers marked the course
on their maps, and wrote out lists of railway
stations. At 3.30 we set off towards
Arras.</p>

<p>Archie hit out as soon as we crossed to
his side of the front. He was especially
dangerous that afternoon, as if determined
to avenge the German defeat of the morning.
Each bus in turn was encircled by
black bursts, and each bus in turn lost height,
swerved, or changed its course to defeat the
gunner's aim. A piece of H.E. hit our tail-plane,
and stayed there until I cut it out for
a souvenir when we had returned.</p>

<p>The observers were kept busy with note-book
and pencil, for the train movement was
far greater than the average, and streaks of
smoke courted attention on all the railways.
Rolling stock was correspondingly small, and
the counting of the trucks in the sidings was
not difficult. Road and canal transport was
plentiful. As evidence of the urgency of all
this traffic, I remarked that no effort at concealment
was made. On ordinary days, a
German train always shut off steam when
we approached; and often I saw transport
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>passing along the road one minute, and not
passing along the road the next. On September
15 the traffic was too urgent for time
to be lost by hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>We passed several of our offensive patrols,
each of which escorted us while we were on
its beat. It was curious that no activity
could be noticed on enemy aerodromes.
Until we passed Mossy-Face on the last lap
of the homeward journey we saw no Hun
aircraft. Even there the machines with black
crosses flew very low and did not attempt to
offer battle.</p>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary happened
until we were about to cross the trenches
north of P&eacute;ronne. Archie then scored an
inner. One of his chunks swept the left
aileron from the leader's machine, which
banked vertically, almost rolled over, and
began to spin. For two thousand feet the
irregular drop continued, and the observer
gave up hope. Luckily for him, the pilot
was not of the same mind, and managed to
check the spin by juggling with his rudder-controls.
The bus flew home, left wing well
down, with the observer leaning far out to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>the right to restore equilibrium, while the
icy rush of air boxed his ears.</p>

<p>We landed, wrote our reports, and took
them to headquarters. The day's work had
been done, which was all that mattered to
any extent, and a very able general told us
it was "dom good." But many a day passed
before we grew accustomed to the absence of
Uncle and Paddy.</p>

<p>And so to bed, until we were called for
another early morning show.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<hr />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><br />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h2>A SUMMER JOY-RIDE.</h2>
<br />

<p>It happened late in the afternoon, one August
dog-day. No wind leavened the languid
air, and hut, hangar, tent, and workshop
were oppressive with a heavy heat, so that
we wanted to sleep. To taxi across the grass
in a chase for flying speed, to soar gently
from the hot ground, and, by leaning beyond
the wind-screen, to let the slip-stream
of displaced air play on one's face&mdash;all this
was refreshing as a cold plunge after a Turkish
bath. I congratulated myself that I was
no longer a gunner, strenuous over interminable
corrections, or tiredly alert in a close
observation post.</p>

<p>Our party consisted of four machines, each
complete with pilot, observer, and several
hundred rounds of ammunition. The job
was an offensive patrol&mdash;that is to say, we
were to hunt trouble around a given area
behind the Boche lines. A great deal of the
credit for our "mastery of the air"&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>glib phrase of the question-asking politician&mdash;during
the Somme Push of 1916, belongs
to those who organised and those who led
these fighting expeditions over enemy country.
Thanks to them, our aircraft were able
to carry out reconnaissance, artillery observation,
and photography with a minimum of
interruption, while the German planes were
so hard pressed to defend their place in the
air that they could seldom guide their own
guns or collect useful information. To this
satisfactory result must be added the irritative
effect on enemy morale of the knowledge
that whenever the weather was fine
our machines hummed overhead, ready to
molest and be molested.</p>

<p>Offensive patrols are well worth while, but
for the comfort of those directly concerned
they are rather too exciting. When friends
are below during an air duel a pilot is warmly
conscious that should he or his machine be
crippled he can break away and land, and
there's an end of it. But if a pilot be
wounded in a scrap far away from home,
before he can land he must fly for many
miles, under shell fire and probably pursued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>by enemies. He must conquer the blighting
faintness which accompanies loss of blood,
keep clear-headed enough to deal instantaneously
with adverse emergency, and make
an unwilling brain command unwilling hands
and feet to control a delicate apparatus.
Worst of all, if his engine be put out of
action at a spot beyond gliding distance of
the lines, there is nothing for it but to descend
and tamely surrender. And always he
is within reach of that vindictive exponent
of frightfulness, Archibald the Ever-Ready.</p>

<p>As we climbed to 4000 feet the machines
above threw glints of sunlight on the screen
of blue infinity. We ranged ourselves and
departed. Passing the red roofs and heart-shaped
citadel of Doulens and a jagged wood
suggestive of a lion rampant, we followed
the straight road to Arras. Arrived there,
the leader turned south, for we were not
yet high enough. As we moved along the
brown band of shell-pocked desolation we
continued to climb. Patches of smoke from
the guns hovered over the ground at intervals.
A score of lazy-looking kite balloons
hung motionless.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>By the time we reached Albert our height
was 12,000 feet, and we steered eastward
over the ground gained in the June-July
advance. Beyond the scrap-heap that once
was Pozi&egrave;res two enormous mine craters
showed up, dented into the razed surface,
one on either side of the Albert-Bapaume
road. Flying very low a few buses were
working on trench reconnaissance. The sunshine
rebounded from the top of their wings,
and against the discoloured earth they looked
like fireflies. A mile or so behind the then
front lines were the twin villages of Courcelette
and Martinpuich, divided only by the
road. Already they were badly battered,
though, unlike Pozi&egrave;res, they still deserved
the title of village. Le Sars, which sat
astride the road, nearer Bapaume, had been
set afire by our guns, and was smoking.</p>

<p>In those days, before the methodical advance
of the British artillery had begun to
worry the stronghold overmuch, Bapaume
was a hotbed of all the anti-aircraft devilries.
We therefore swerved toward the south.
Archie was not to be shaken off so easily,
and we began a series of erratic deviations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>as he ringed with black puffs first one machine,
then another. The shooting was not
particularly good; for although no clouds intervened
between the guns and their mark,
a powerful sun dazzled the gunners, who
must have found difficulty in judging height
and direction. From Archie's point of view,
the perfect sky is one screened from the
sunlight, at 20,000 to 30,000 feet, by a mantle
of thin clouds against which aircraft are
outlined boldly, like stags on a snow-covered
slope.</p>

<p>A few minutes in a south-easterly direction
brought us to the Bois d'Havrincourt,
a large ungainly wood, the shape of which
was something between the ace of spades
and the ace of clubs. This we knew as
Mossy-Face. The region around it was
notorious in R.F.C. messes as being the
chief centre of the Boche Flying Corps
on the British Front.</p>

<p>From the south-west corner Archie again
scattered burst and bark at our group, but
his inaccuracy made dodging hardly necessary.
A lull followed, and I twisted my
neck all round the compass, for, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>presence of hostile aeroplanes, Archie seldom
behaves, except when friendly machines are
about. Two thousand feet below three
biplanes were approaching the wood from
the south. Black crosses showed up plainly
on their grey-white wings. We dropped
into a dive toward the strangers.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions a steep dive
imparts a feeling of being hemmed in from
every side. One takes a deep breath instinctively,
and the novice to flying will
grip the fuselage, as if to avoid being crushed.
And, indeed, a passenger in a diving aeroplane
is hemmed in, by the terrific air-pressure
to which the solid surface is subjected. If
he attempt to stand up or lean over the
side, he will be swept back, after a short
struggle, beneath the shelter of wind-screen
and fuselage. But when diving on a Hun,
I have never experienced this troubled sensation,
probably because it has been swamped
under the high tension of readiness for the
task. All the faculties must be concentrated
on opening the attack, since an air duel is
often decided in the first few seconds at
close quarters. What happens during these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>few seconds may depend on a trifle, such
as the position of the gun-mounting, an
untried drum of ammunition, a slight swerve,
or firing a second too soon or too late. An
airman should regard his body as part of
the machine when there is a prospect of a
fight, and his brain, which commands the
machine, must be instinctive with insight
into what the enemy will attempt.</p>

<p>As we dived, then, I estimated the angle
at which we might cross the Boche trio,
watched for a change of direction on their
part, slewed round the gun-mounting to the
most effective setting for what would probably
be my arc of fire, and fingered the
movable back-sight. At first the Huns held
to their course as though quite unconcerned.
Later, they began to lose height. Their
downward line of flight became steeper and
steeper, and so did ours.</p>

<p>Just as our leading bus arrived within
range and began to spit bullets through the
propeller, a signal rocket streaked from the
first Boche biplane, and the trio dived almost
vertically, honking the while on Klaxon
horns. We were then at about 6000 feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>We were expecting to see the Huns flatten
out, when&mdash;"<i>Wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i>
<i>wouff!</i>" said Archie. The German birds
were not hawks at all; they were merely
tame decoys used to entice us to a pre-arranged
spot, at a height well favoured by
A.-A. gunners. The ugly puffs encircled
us, and it seemed unlikely that an aeroplane
could get away without being caught
in a patch of hurtling high explosive. Yet
nobody was hit. The only redeeming feature
of the villain Archibald is that his deeds
are less terrible than his noise, and even
this is too flat to be truly frightful. Although
I was uncomfortable as we raced
away, the chorused <i>wouffs!</i> reminded me of
an epidemic of coughing I heard in church
one winter's Sunday, while a fatuous sermon
was read by a dull-voiced vicar.</p>

<p>Mingled with the many black bursts were
a few green ones, probably gas shells, for
Archie had begun to experiment with the
gas habit. Very suddenly a line of fiery
rectangles shot up and curved towards us
when they had reached three-quarters of
their maximum height. They rose and fell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>within thirty yards of our tail. These were
"onions," the flaming rockets which the
Boche keeps for any hostile aircraft that
can be lured to a height between 4000 and
6000 feet.</p>

<p>I yelled to V., my pilot, that we should
have to dodge. We side-slipped and swerved
to the left. A minute later the stream of
onions had disappeared, greatly to my relief,
for the prospect of a fire in the air inspires
in me a mortal funk. Soon we were
to pass from the unpleasant possibility to
the far more unpleasant reality.</p>

<p>Once outside the unhealthy region, we
climbed to a less dangerous height. Again
we became the target for a few dozen H.E.
shells. We broke away and swooped downward.
Some little distance ahead, and not
far below, was a group of five Albatross
two-seaters. V. pointed our machine at
them, in the wake of the flight-commander's
bus.</p>

<p>Next instant the fuselage shivered. I
looked along the inside of it and found that
a burning shell fragment was lodged on a
longeron, half-way between my cockpit and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>the tail-plane. A little flame zigzagged over
the fabric, all but died away, but, being
fanned by the wind as we lost height, recovered
and licked its way toward the tail.
I was too far away to reach the flame with
my hands, and the fire extinguisher was by
the pilot's seat. I called for it into the
speaking-tube. The pilot made no move.
Once more I shouted. Again no answer.
V.'s earpiece had slipped from under his
cap. A thrill of acute fear passed through
me as I stood up, forced my arm through
the rush of wind, and grabbed V.'s shoulder.</p>

<p>"Fuselage burning! Pass the fire extinguisher!"
I yelled.</p>

<p>My words were drowned in the engine's
roar; and the pilot, intent on getting near
the Boches, thought I had asked which one
we were to attack.</p>

<p>"Look out for those two Huns on the
left," he called over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Pass the fire extinguisher!"</p>

<p>"Get ready to shoot, blast you!"</p>

<p>"Fire extinguisher, you ruddy fool!"</p>

<p>A backward glance told me that the fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>was nearing the tail-plane at the one end
and my box of ammunition at the other,
and was too serious for treatment by the
extinguisher unless I could get it at once.
Desperately I tried to force myself through
the bracing-struts and cross-wires behind my
seat. To my surprise, head and shoulders
and one arm got to the other side&mdash;a curious
circumstance, as afterwards I tried repeatedly
to repeat this contortionist trick on the
ground, but failed every time. There I
stuck, for it was impossible to wriggle farther.
However, I could now reach part of the fire,
and at it I beat with gloved hands. Within
half a minute most of the fire was crushed
to death. But a thin streak of flame, outside
the radius of my arm, still flickered
towards the tail. I tore off one of my gauntlets
and swung it furiously on to the burning
strip. The flame lessened, rose again
when I raised the glove, but died out altogether
after I had hit it twice more. The
load of fear left me, and I discovered an
intense discomfort, wedged in as I was
between the two crossed bracing-struts. Five
minutes passed before I was able, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>many a heave and gasp, to withdraw back
to my seat.</p>

<p>By now we were at close grips with the
enemy, and our machine and another converged
on a Hun. V. was firing industriously.
As we turned, he glared at me,
and knowing nothing of the fire, shouted:
"Why the hell haven't you fired yet?" I
caught sight of a Boche bus below us, aimed
at it, and emptied a drum in short bursts.
It swept away, but not before two of the
German observer's bullets had plugged our
petrol tank from underneath. The pressure
went, and with it the petrol supply. The
needle on the rev.-counter quivered to the
left as the revolutions dropped, and the
engine missed on first one, then two cylinders.
V. turned us round, and, with nose
down, headed the machine for the trenches.
Just then the engine ceased work altogether,
and we began to glide down.</p>

<p>All this happened so quickly that I had
scarcely realised our plight. Next I began
to calculate our chances of reaching the
lines before we would have to land. Our
height was 9000 feet, and we were just over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>nine and a half miles from friendly territory.
Reckoning the gliding possibilities of our
type of bus as a mile to a thousand feet,
the odds seemed unfavourable. On the
other hand, a useful wind had arisen from
the east, and V., a very skilful pilot, would
certainly cover all the distance that could
be covered.</p>

<p>I located our exact position and searched
the map for the nearest spot in the lines.
The village of Bouchavesnes was a fraction
south of due west, and I remembered that
the French had stormed it two days previously.
From the shape of the line before
this advance, there was evidently a small
salient, with Bouchavesnes in the middle of
the curve. I scribbled this observation on a
scrap of paper, which I handed to V. with
the compass direction. V. checked my statements
on the map, nodded over his shoulder,
and set a course for Bouchavesnes.</p>

<p>Could we do it? I prayed to the gods
and trusted to the pilot. Through my mind
there flitted impossible plans to be tried if
we landed in Boche territory. After setting
fire to the machine we would attempt to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>hide, and then, at night-time, creep along
a communication trench to the enemy front
line, jump across it in a gap between the
sentries, and chance getting by the barbed
wire and across No Man's Land. Or we
would steal to the Somme, float down-stream,
and somehow or other pass the entanglements
placed across the river by the enemy.
<i>Wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> Archie was complicating the
odds.</p>

<p>Further broodings were checked by the
sudden appearance of a German scout. Taking
advantage of our plight, its pilot dived
steeply from a point slightly behind us. We
could not afford to lose any distance by
dodging, so V. did the only thing possible&mdash;he
kept straight on. I raised my gun, aimed
at the wicked-looking nose of the attacking
craft, and met it with a barrage of bullets.
These must have worried the Boche, for he
swerved aside when a hundred and fifty
yards distant, and did not flatten out until
he was beneath the tail of our machine.
Afterwards he climbed away from us, turned,
and dived once more. For a second time we
escaped, owing either to some lucky shots
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>from my gun or to the lack of judgment by
the Hun pilot. The scout pulled up and
passed ahead of us. It rose and man&oelig;uvred
as if to dive from the front and bar the way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, four specks, approaching from
the west, had grown larger and larger, until
they were revealed as of the F.E. type&mdash;the
British "pusher" two-seater. The Boche
saw them, and hesitated as they bore down
on him. Finding himself in the position of a
lion attacked by hunters when about to
pounce on a tethered goat, he decided not to
destroy, for in so doing he would have laid
himself open to destruction. When I last
saw him he was racing north-east.</p>

<p>There was now no obstacle to the long
glide. As we went lower, the torn ground
showed up plainly. From 2000 feet I could
almost count the shell-holes. Two battery
positions came into view, and near one of
them I saw tracks and could distinguish
movements by a few tiny dots. It became
evident that, barring accident, we should
reach the French zone.</p>

<p>When slightly behind the trenches a confused
chatter from below told us that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>machine-guns
were trained on the machine. By
way of retaliation, I leaned over and shot at
what looked like an emplacement. Then
came the Boche front line, ragged and unkempt.
I fired along an open trench. Although
far from fearless as a rule, I was
not in the least afraid during the eventful
glide. My state of intense "wind up" while
the fuselage was burning had apparently exhausted
my stock of nervousness. I seemed
detached from all idea of danger, and the
desolated German trench area might have
been a side-show at a fair.</p>

<p>We swept by No Man's Land at a height
of 600 feet, crossed the French first- and
second-line trenches, and, after passing a
small ridge, prepared to settle on an uneven
plateau covered by high bracken. To avoid
landing down wind and down-hill, the pilot
banked to the right before he flattened out.
The bus pancaked gently to earth, ran over
the bracken, and stopped two yards from a
group of shell-holes. Not a wire was broken.
The propeller had been scored by the
bracken, but the landing was responsible for
no other damage. Taking into consideration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>the broken ground, the short space at our
disposal, and the fact that we landed cross-wind,
V. had exhibited wonderful skill.</p>

<p>We climbed out, relieved but cantankerous.
V., still ignorant of the fire, wanted
to know why my gun was silent during our
first fight; and I wanted to know why he
hadn't shut off the engine and listened when
I shouted for the fire extinguisher. Some
French gunners ran to meet us. The sight
that met them must have seemed novel, even
to a poilu of two and a half years' understanding.</p>

<p>Supposing that the aeroplane had crashed,
they came to see if we were dead or injured.
What they found was one almost complete
aeroplane and two leather-coated figures, who
cursed each other heartily as they stood side
by side, and performed a certain natural
function which is publicly represented in
Brussels by a famous little statue.</p>

<p>"Quels types!" said the first Frenchman
to arrive.</p>

<p>An examination of the bus revealed a fair
crop of bullet holes through the wings and
elevator. A large gap in one side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>fuselage, over a longeron that was charred
to powder in parts, bore witness to the fire.
Petrol was dripping from the spot where the
tank had been perforated. On taking a tin
of chocolate from his pocket, V. found it
ripped and gaping. He searched the pocket
and discovered a bright bullet at the bottom.
We traced the adventures of that bullet; it
had grazed a strut, cut right through the
petrol union, and expended itself on the
chocolate tin.</p>

<p>Soon our attention was attracted to several
French machines that were passing
through a barrage of Archie bursts. The
bombardment of an aeroplane arouses only
the sporting instinct of the average soldier.
His interest, though keen, is directed towards
the quality of the shooting and the
distance of the shells for their target; his
attitude when watching a pigeon-shoot would
be much the same. But an airman has
experience of what the aeroplane crews must
be going through, and his thought is all for
them. He knows that dull, loud cough of
an Archie shell, the hiss of a flying fragment,
the wicked black puffs that creep <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>towards
their mark and follow it, no matter
where the pilot may swerve. Should a
friendly machine tumble to earth after that
rare occurrence, a direct hit, all the sensations
of an uncontrolled nose-dive are suggested to
his senses. He hears the shriek of the up-rushing
air, feels the helpless terror. It
hurts him to know that he is powerless to
save a friend from certain death. He cannot
even withdraw his eyes from the falling
craft. I was glad we had not viewed the
disaster while we were in the air, for nothing
is more unnerving than to see another machine
crumbled up by a direct hit when
Archie is firing at yourself.</p>

<p>"Me," said a French gunner by my side,
"I prefer the artillery." With which sentiment
I have often agreed when dodging
Archie, though at every other time I prefer
the Flying Corps work to all other kinds of
fighting.</p>

<p>V. disappeared to phone the Squadron
Commander, and I was left with the crippled
bus and the crowd of Frenchmen. The poilus
questioned me on subjects ranging from the
customary length of a British officer's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>moustache
to the possible length of the war. Yes,
we had been hit in a fight with Boche aeroplanes.
Yes, there had also been a slight fire
on board. Yes, I had great fear at the time.
Yes, I would accept a cigarette with pleasure.
No, it was untrue that England contained
four million civilian <i>embusqu&eacute;s</i> of military
age. No, the report that officers of the
British Flying Corps received fifty francs a
day was inaccurate, unfortunately. But no,
my good-for-nothing opinion was that we
should not finish the Boche within a year;
and so on.</p>

<p>"How is it," said one man in faded uniform,
"that the British always manage to
keep themselves correct and shaven?"</p>

<p>"La barbe!" interrupted another; "the
Tommies don't keep clean on the Somme.
Even the lilies of the &eacute;tat-majeur can't."
And he began to quote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si ma fi-fi-fianc&eacute;e me voyait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elle m' dirait en me donnant cinq sous:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Va t' faire raser!' mais moi, j' r&eacute;pondrais<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que moi j'ai toujours les m&ecirc;mes deux joues."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>V. was away for an hour and a half and
when he did return it was to announce that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>he had been unable to phone because the
line was blocked under pressure of important
operations. Deciding to report in person,
we declined an offer of hospitality from
the French officers, but gratefully accepted a
guard for the machine, and the loan of a
car.</p>

<p>A young lieutenant accompanied us as far
as Amiens. There we stopped for supper,
and were joined by some civilian friends of
our French companion. The <i>filet de sole au
vin blanc</i> engendered a feeling of deep content.
Now that it was over, I felt pleased
with the day's excitement and the contrast
it afforded. Three hours beforehand it
seemed likely that the evening would see us
prisoners. Yet here we were, supping in a
comfortable hotel with three charming ladies
and the widow Clicquot.</p>

<p>Arrived at the aerodrome, we visited the
hut inhabited by the Squadron Commander,
who wore pyjamas and a smile of welcome.
We were just in time, he said, to rescue our
names from the list of missing. Our tale
impressed him so much that, after making
arrangements for the stranded bus to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>brought back by a repair party, he remarked:
"You can both have a rest to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Welcome home, you rotten night-bird,"
said my tent companion, and mentioned in a
hurt tone that our flight was booked for the
5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> reconnaissance. But my last thought
before sinking into sleep was of the blessed
words: "You can have a rest to-morrow."</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<hr />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><br />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h2>SPYING OUT THE LAND.</h2>
<br />

<p>For thirty hours the flight had "stood by"
for a long reconnaissance. We were dragged
from bed at 4.30 of dawn, only to return
gratefully beneath the blankets three-quarters
of an hour later, when a slight but steady
rain washed away all chance of an immediate
job. The drizzle continued until after
sundown, and our only occupations throughout
the day were to wade from mess to aerodrome,
aerodrome to mess, and to overhaul
in detail machines, maps, guns, and consciences.</p>

<p>Next morning again we dressed in the
half-light, and again went back to bed in
the daylight. This time the show had been
postponed because of low clouds and a thick
ground-mist that hung over the reeking earth.
It was a depressing dawn&mdash;clammy, moist,
and sticky.</p>

<p>But by early afternoon the mist had congealed,
and the sheet of clouds was torn to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>rags by a strong south-west wind. The four
craft detailed for the reconnaissance were
therefore lined outside their shed, while their
crews waited for flying orders. I was to be
in the leading bus, for when C.'s death left
vacant the command of A Flight, the good
work of my pilot had brought him a flight-commandership,
a three-pipped tunic, and a
sense of responsibility which, to my relief,
checked his tendency to over-recklessness.
He now came from the squadron office with
news of a changed course.</p>

<p>"To get the wind behind us," he explained,
"we shall cross well to the south
of P&eacute;ronne. Next, we go to Boislens. After
that we pass by Nimporte, over the For&ecirc;t
de Charbon to Si&egrave;gecourt; then up to Le
Recul and back by Princebourg, St. Guillaume,
and Toutpr&egrave;s.</p>

<p>"As regards the observers, don't forget to
use your field-glasses on the rolling stock;
don't forget the precise direction of trains
and motor transport; don't forget the railways
and roads on every side; don't forget
the canals; and for the Lord's and everybody
else's sake, don't be surprised by Hun
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>aircraft. As regards the pilots&mdash;keep in
close formation when possible; don't straggle
and don't climb above the proper height."</p>

<p>The pilots ran their engines once more,
and the observers exchanged information
about items such as Hun aerodromes and
the number of railway stations at each large
town. An air reconnaissance is essentially
the observer's show; its main object being to
supply the "I" people at headquarters with
private bulletins from the back of the German
front. The collection of reconnaissance
reports is work of a highly skilled nature, or
ought to be. Spying out the land is much
more than a search of railways, roads, and
the terrain generally. The experienced observer
must know the German area over
which he works rather better than he knows
Salisbury Plain. The approximate position
of railway junctions and stations, aerodromes,
factories, and dep&ocirc;ts should be familiar to
him, so that he can without difficulty spot
any new feature. Also he must be something
of a sleuth, particularly when using
smoke as a clue. In the early morning a
thin layer of smoke above a wood may mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>a bivouac. If it be but a few miles behind
the lines, it can evidence heavy artillery. A
narrow stream of smoke near a railway will
make an observer scan the line closely for a
stationary train, as the Boche engine-drivers
usually try to avoid detection by shutting
off steam. The Hun has many other dodges
to avoid publicity. When Allied aircraft appear,
motor and horse transport remain immobile
at the roadside or under trees.
Artillery and infantry are packed under
cover; though, for that matter, the enemy
very rarely move troops in the daytime,
preferring the night or early morning, when
there are no troublesome eyes in the air.</p>

<p>To foil these attempts at concealment is
the business of the observers who gather
information for Army Headquarters and G.
H.Q. For observers on corps work the detective
problems are somewhat different.
This department deals with hidden saps and
battery positions, and draws and photographs
conclusions from clues such as a
muzzle-blast, fresh tracks, or an artificial
cluster of trees. All reconnaissance observers
must carry out a simultaneous search of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>earth for movement and the sky for foes,
and in addition keep their guns ready for
instant use. And should anything happen to
their machines, and a forced landing seem
likely, they must sit tight and carry on so
long as there is the slightest hope of a safe
return.</p>

<p>A nos moutons. I made a long list in
my note-book of the places where something
useful was likely to be observed, and
tried my gun by firing a few shots into the
ground. We hung around, impatient at the
long delay.</p>

<p>"Get into your machines," called the
Squadron Commander at last, when a telephone
message had reported that the weather
conditions toward the east were no longer
unfavourable. We took to the air and set
off.</p>

<p>V. led his covey beyond Albert and well
south of the Somme before he turned to the
left. Then, with the strong wind behind us,
we raced north-east and crossed the strip of
trenches. The pilot of the emergency machine,
which had come thus far to join the
party if one of the other four dropped out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>waved his hand in farewell and left for home.</p>

<p>Archie barked at us immediately, but he
caused small trouble, as most of his attention
was already claimed by a party of
French machines half a mile ahead. Anyhow
we should have shaken him off quickly,
for at this stage of the journey, with a forty-mile
wind reinforcing our usual air speed
of about ninety-five miles an hour, our
ground speed was sufficient to avoid lingering
in any region made unhealthy by A.-A.
guns. The water-marked ribbon of trenches
seemed altogether puny and absurd during
the few seconds when it was within sight.
The winding Somme was dull and dirty as
the desolation of its surrounding basin. Some
four thousand feet above the ground a few
clouds moved restlessly at the bidding of
the wind.</p>

<p>Passing a few small woods, we arrived
without interruption over the railway junction
of Boislens. With arms free of the
machine to avoid unnecessary vibration, the
observers trained their glasses on the station
and estimated the amount of rolling stock.
A close search of the railway arteries only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>revealed one train. I grabbed pencil and
note-book and wrote: "Boislens, 3.5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> 6
R.S., 1 train going S.W."</p>

<p>Just west of our old friend Mossy-Face
were two rows of flagrantly new trenches.
As this is one of the points where the enemy
made a stand after their 1917 spring retreat,
it can be assumed that even as far back as
last October they were preparing new lines
of defence, Hindenburg or otherwise. Not
far west of these defence works were two
troublesome aerodromes at Bertincourt and
Velu, both of which places have since been
captured.</p>

<p>A hunt for an aerodrome followed. V.,
who knew the neighbourhood well, having
passed above it some two-score times, was
quick to spot a group of hitherto unnoted
sheds north of Boislens, towards Mossy-Face.
He circled over them to let me plot
the pin-point position on the map and sketch
the aerodrome and its surroundings. The
Hun pilots, with thoughts of a possible bomb-raid,
began to take their machines into the
air for safety.</p>

<p>"Got 'em all?" Thus V., shouting through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>the rubber speaking-tube, one end of which
was fixed inside my flying-cap, so that it
always rested against my ear.</p>

<p>"Correct. Get on with the good work."</p>

<p>The good work led us over a region for
ever associated with British arms. Some
of the towns brought bitter memories of
that anxious August three years back. Thus
Nimporte, which saw a desperate but successful
stand on one flank of the contemptible
little army to gain time for the main
body; Ventregris, scene of a cavalry charge
that was a glorious tragedy; L&agrave;bas, where a
battery of horse-gunners made for itself an
imperishable name; Si&egrave;gecourt, where the
British might have retired into a trap but
didn't; and Le Recul itself, whence they
slipped away just in time.</p>

<p>In the station at Nimporte a train was
waiting to move off, and two more were on
their way to the military base of Pluspr&egrave;s.
Both attempted to hide their heads by shutting
off steam immediately the drone of our
engines made itself heard; but we had spotted
them from afar, and already they were noted
for the information of Brass Hats.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>The next item of interest was activity at
a factory outside a little town. Black trails
of smoke stretched away from the chimneys;
and surely, as we approached a minute ago,
a short column of lorries was passing along
a road towards the factory. Yet when we
reached the spot there was no sign of road
transport. Nevertheless, I was certain I had
seen some motor vehicles, and I entered the
fact in my note-book. Likewise I took care
to locate the factory site on my map, in
case it deserved the honour of a bomb attack
later.</p>

<p>Our bus led the way across the huge unwieldy
For&ecirc;t de Charbon, patterned in rectangular
fashion by intersecting roads, and
we arrived at Si&egrave;gecourt. This is at once
a fortress and an industrial town. There are
several railway stations around it, and these
added greatly to the observers' collection of
trains and trucks. The Huns below, with
unpleasant memories of former visits from
British aircraft, probably expected to be
bombed. They threw up at us a large quantity
of high-explosive shells, but the shots
were all wide and we remained unworried.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>To judge by the quality of the A.-A. shooting
each time I called there, it seemed likely
that half-trained A.-A. gunners were allowed
to cut their active service teeth on us at
Si&egrave;gecourt.</p>

<p>Having squeezed Si&egrave;gecourt of all movement,
we headed for Le Recul. Here the
intricate patchwork of railway kept the observers
busy, and six more trains were
bagged. Then, as this was the farthest point
east to be touched, we turned to the left and
travelled homeward.</p>

<p>It was soon afterwards that our engine
went dud. Instead of a rhythmic and continuous
hum there was at regular intervals
a break, caused by one of the cylinders
missing explosion at each turn of the rotary
engine. The rev.-counter showed that the
number of revolutions per minute had fallen
off appreciably. Decreased revs. meant less
speed, and our only chance to keep with the
others was to lose height continuously. We
were then nearly fifty miles from the lines.</p>

<p>I noticed the gap in the engine's drone as
soon as it began. An airman is accustomed
to the full roar of his engine, and it never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>distracts his attention, any more than the
noise of a waterfall distracts those who live
near it. But if the roar becomes non-continuous
and irregular he is acutely conscious
of the sound.</p>

<p>When the machine began to lose height
I knew there was a chronic miss. V. looked
round and smiled reassuringly, though he
himself was far from reassured. He tried
an alteration in the carburettor mixture, but
this did not remedy matters. Next, thinking
that the engine might have been slightly
choked, he cut off the petrol supply for a
moment and put down the nose of the machine.
The engine stopped, but picked up
when the petrol was once more allowed to
run. During the interval I thought the
engine had ceased work altogether, and was
about to stuff things into my pocket in readiness
for a landing on hostile ground.</p>

<p>We continued in a westerly direction, with
the one cylinder still cutting out. To make
matters worse, the strong wind that had
been our friend on the outward journey
was now an enemy, for it was drifting us
to the north, so that we were obliged to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>steer almost dead into it to follow the set
course.</p>

<p>As we passed along the straight canal
from Le Recul to Princebourg many barges
were in evidence. Those at the side of the
canal were taken to be moored up, and those
in the middle to be moving, though the slowness
of their speed made it impossible to
decide on their direction, for from a height of
ten thousand feet they seemed to be stationary.
About a dozen Hun machines were
rising from aerodromes at Passementerie,
away to the left, but if they were after us
the attempt to reach our height in time was
futile.</p>

<p>Between Le Recul and Princebourg we
dropped fifteen hundred feet below the three
rear machines, which hovered above us.
Though I was far from feeling at home, it
was necessary to sweep the surrounding
country for transport of all kinds. This was
done almost automatically, since I found
myself unable to give a whole-hearted attention
to the job, while the infernal motif of
the engine's rag-time drone dominated everything
and invited speculation on how much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>lower we were than the others, and whether
we were likely to reach a friendly landing-ground.
And all the while a troublesome
verse chose very inopportunely to race across
the background of my mind, in time with the
engine, each cut-out being the end of a line.
Once or twice I caught myself murmuring&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In that poor but honest 'ome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where 'er sorrowin' parints live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They drink the shampyne wine she sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never, never can fergive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slightly to the east of Princebourg, a new
complication appeared in the shape of a
small German machine. Seeing that our
bus was in difficulties, it awaited an opportunity
to pounce, and remained at a height
slightly greater than ours, but some distance
behind the bus that acted as rearguard to
the party. Its speed must have been about
ten miles an hour more than our own, for
though the Hun pilot had probably throttled
down, he was obliged to make his craft snake
its way in short curves, so that it should not
come within dangerous range of our guns.
At times he varied this method by lifting
the machine almost to stalling point, letting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>her down again, and repeating the process.
Once I saw some motor transport on a road.
I leaned over the side to estimate their number,
but gave up the task of doing so with
accuracy under the double strain of watching
the Hun scout and listening to the jerky
voice of the engine.</p>

<p>As we continued to drop, the German
evidently decided to finish us. He climbed
a little and then rushed ahead. I fired at
him in rapid bursts, but he kept to his course.
He did not come near enough for a dive,
however, as the rest of the party, two thousand
feet above, had watched his movements,
and as soon as he began to move nearer two
of them fell towards him. Seeing that his
game was spoiled the Boche went down
steeply, and only flattened out when he was
low enough to be safe from attack.</p>

<p>Near St Guillaume an anti-aircraft battery
opened fire. The Hun pilot then
thought it better to leave Archie to deal
with us, and he annoyed us no more. Some
of the shell-bursts were quite near, but we
could not afford to lose height in distance-dodging,
with our machine in a dubious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>condition
twenty-five miles on the wrong side
of the trenches.</p>

<p>Toutpr&egrave;s, to the south-west, was to have
been included in the list of towns covered,
but under the adverse circumstances V. decided
not to battle against the wind more
than was necessary to get us home. He
therefore veered to the right, and steered
due west. The south-west wind cut across
and drifted us, so that our actual course was
north-west. Our ground speed was now a
good deal greater than if we had travelled
directly west, and there was no extra distance
to be covered, because of a large eastward
bend in the lines as they wound north.
We skirted the ragged For&ecirc;t de Quand-M&ecirc;me,
and passed St Guillaume on our left.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the engine went from
bad to worse, and the vibration became
more and more intense. Once again I
thought it would peter out before we were
within gliding distance of British territory,
and I therefore made ready to burn the
machine&mdash;the last duty of an airman let
in for the catastrophe of a landing among
enemies. But the engine kept alive, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>obstinately
and unevenly. V. held down the
nose of the machine still farther, so as to
gain the lines in the quickest possible time.</p>

<p>Soon we were treated to a display by the
family ghost of the clan Archibald, otherwise
an immense pillar of grey-white smoky
substance that appeared very suddenly to
windward of us. It stretched up vertically
from the ground to a height about level
with ours, which was then only five and a
half thousand feet. We watched it curiously
as it stood in an unbending rigidity similar
to that of a giant waxwork, cold, unnatural,
stupidly implacable, half unbelievable, and
wholly ridiculous. At the top it sprayed
round, like a stick of asparagus. For two
or three months similar apparitions had been
exhibited to us at rare intervals, nearly always
in the same neighbourhood. At first
sight the pillars of smoke seemed not to
disperse, but after an interval they apparently
faded away as mysteriously as they
had appeared. What was meant to be their
particular branch of frightfulness I cannot
say. One rumour was that they were an
experiment in aerial gassing, and another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>that they were of some phosphorous compound.
All I know is that they entertained
us from time to time, with no apparent
damage.</p>

<p>Archie quickly distracted our attention
from the phantom pillar. We had been
drifted to just south of Lille, possibly the
hottest spot on the whole western front as
regards anti-aircraft fire. Seeing one machine
four to five thousand feet below its
companions, the gunners very naturally concentrated
on it. A spasmodic chorus of
barking coughs drowned the almost equally
spasmodic roar of the engine. V. dodged
steeply and then raced, full out, for the lines.
A sight of the dirty brown jig-saw of trenches
heartened us greatly. A few minutes later
we were within gliding distance of the British
front. When we realised that even if
the engine lost all life we could reach safety,
nothing else seemed to matter, not even the
storm of shell-bursts.</p>

<p>Suddenly the machine quivered, swung to
the left, and nearly put itself in a flat spin.
A large splinter of H.E. had sliced away
part of the rudder. V. banked to prevent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>an uncontrolled side-slip, righted the bus as
far as possible, and dived for the lines. These
we passed at a great pace, but we did not
shake off Archie until well on the right side,
for at our low altitude the high-angle guns
had a large radius of action that could include
us. However, the menacing coughs
finally ceased to annoy, and our immediate
troubles were over. The strain snapped, the
air was an exhilarating tonic, the sun was
warmly comforting, and everything seemed
attractive, even the desolated jumble of
waste ground below us. I opened a packet
of chocolate and shared it with V., who
was trying hard to fly evenly with an uneven
rudder. I sang to him down the speaking-tube,
but his nerves had stood enough
for the day, and he wriggled the machine
from one side to the other until I became
silent. Contrariwise to the last, our engine
recovered slightly now that its recovery was
not so important, and it behaved well until
it seized up for better or worse when we had
landed.</p>

<p>From the aerodrome the pilots proceeded
to tea and a bath, while we, the unfortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>observers, copied our notes into a detailed
report, elaborated the sketches of the new
aerodromes, and drove in our unkempt state
to Headquarters, there to discuss the reconnaissance
with spotlessly neat staff officers.
At the end of the report one must give the
height at which the job was done, and say
whether the conditions were favourable or
otherwise for observation. I thought of the
absence of thick clouds or mist that might
have made the work difficult. Then I thought
of the cylinder that missed and the chunk of
rudder that was missing, but decided that
these little inconveniences were unofficial.
And the legend I felt in duty bound to write
was: "Height 5,000-10,000 ft. Observation
easy."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h2>THERE AND BACK.</h2>
<br />

<p>An inhuman philosopher or a strong, silent
poseur might affect to treat with indifference
his leave from the Front. Personally
I have never met a philosopher inhuman
enough or a poseur strongly silent enough to
repress evidence of wild satisfaction, after
several months of war at close quarters, on
being given a railway warrant entitling him
to ten days of England, home, and no duty.
But if you are a normal soldier who dislikes
fighting and detests discomfort, the date of
your near-future holiday from the dreary
scene of war will be one of the few problems
that really matter.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a slump in great pushes
at your sector of the line, since only during
the interval of attack is the leave-list unpigeonholed.
The weeks pass and your turn
creeps close, while you pray that the lull
may last until the day when, with a heavy
haversack and a light heart, you set off to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>become a transient in Arcadia. The desire
for a taste of freedom is sharpened by
delay; but finally, after disappointment and
postponement, the day arrives and you depart.
Exchanging a "So long" with less
fortunate members of the mess, you realise a
vast difference in respective destinies. To-morrow
the others will be dodging crumps,
archies, or official chits "for your information,
please"; to-morrow, with luck, you will
be dodging taxis in London.</p>

<p>During the journey you begin to cast out
the oppressive feeling that a world and a
half separates you from the pleasantly undisciplined
life you once led. The tense
influence of those twin bores of active service,
routine and risk, gradually loosens hold,
and your state of mind is tuned to a pitch
half-way between the note of battle and that
of a bank-holiday.</p>

<p>Yet a slight sense of remoteness lingers as
you enter London. At first view the Charing
Cross loiterers seem more foreign than
the peasants of Picardy, the Strand and
Piccadilly less familiar than the Albert-Pozi&egrave;res
road. Not till a day or two later,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>when the remnants of strained pre-occupation
with the big things of war have been
charmed away by old haunts and old friends,
do you feel wholly at home amid your rediscovered
fellow-citizens, the Man in the Street,
the Pacifist, the air-raid-funk Hysteric, the
Lady Flag-Seller, the War Profiteer, the dear-boy
Fluff Girl, the Prohibitionist, the England-for-the-Irish
politician, the Conscientious
Objector, the hotel-government bureaucrat,
and other bulwarks of our united Empire.
For the rest, you will want to cram into
ten short days the average experiences of
ten long weeks. If, like most of us, you
are young and foolish, you will skim the
bubbling froth of life and seek crowded diversion
in the lighter follies, the passing
shows, and l'amour qui rit. And you will
probably return to the big things of war
tired but mightily refreshed, and almost ready
to welcome a further spell of routine and
risk.</p>

<p>The one unsatisfactory aspect of leave
from France, apart from its rarity, is the
travelling. This, in a region congested by
the more important traffic of war, is slow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>and burdensome to the impatient holiday-maker.
Occasionally the Flying Corps officer
is able to substitute an excursion by
air for the land and water journey, if on
one of the dates that sandwich his leave
a bus of the type already flown by him must
be chauffeured across the Channel. Such an
opportunity is welcome, for besides avoiding
discomfort, a joy-ride of this description
often saves time enough to provide an extra
day in England.</p>

<p>On the last occasion when I was let loose
from the front on ticket-of-leave, I added
twenty-four hours to my Blighty period by
a chance meeting with a friendly ferry-pilot
and a resultant trip as passenger in an aeroplane
from a home dep&ocirc;t. Having covered
the same route by train and boat a few days
previously, a comparison between the two
methods of travel left me an enthusiast for
aerial transport in the golden age of after-the-war.</p>

<p>The leave train at Arri&egrave;re was time-tabled
for midnight, but as, under a war-time edict,
French caf&eacute;s and places where they lounge
are closed at 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, it was at this hour that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>muddied officers and Tommies from every
part of the Somme basin began to crowd
the station.</p>

<p>Though confronted with a long period of
waiting, in a packed entrance-hall that was
only half-lit and contained five seats to be
scrambled for by several hundred men, every
one, projected beyond the immediate discomfort
to the good time coming, seemed content.
The atmosphere of jolly expectancy
was comparable to that of Waterloo Station
on the morning of Derby Day. Scores of
little groups gathered to talk the latest shop-talk
from the trenches. A few of us who
were acquainted with the corpulent and affable
R.T.O.&mdash;it is part of an R.T.O.'s stock-in-trade
to be corpulent and affable&mdash;sought
out his private den, and exchanged yarns
while commandeering his whisky. Stuff Redoubt
had been stormed a few days previously,
and a Canadian captain, who had
been among the first to enter the Hun stronghold,
told of the assault. A sapper discussed
some recent achievements of mining parties.
A tired gunner subaltern spoke viciously of
a stupendous bombardment that allowed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>little
rest, less sleep, and no change of clothes.
Time was overcome easily in thus looking at
war along the varying angles of the infantryman,
the gunner, the engineer, the machine-gun
performer, and the flying officer, all
fresh from their work.</p>

<p>The train, true to the custom of leave
trains, was very late. When it did arrive,
the good-natured jostling for seats again reminded
one of the London to Epsom traffic
of Derby Day. Somehow the crowd was
squeezed into carriage accommodation barely
sufficient for two-thirds of its number, and
we left Arri&egrave;re. Two French and ten British
officers obtained a minimum of space in my
compartment. We sorted out our legs, arms,
and luggage, and tried to rest.</p>

<p>In my case sleep was ousted by thoughts
of what was ahead. Ten days' freedom in
England! The stout major on my left
snored. The head of the hard-breathing
Frenchman to the right slipped on to my
shoulder. An unkempt subaltern opposite
wriggled and turned in a vain attempt to
find ease. I was damnably cramped, but
above all impatient for the morrow. A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>passing
train shrieked. Cold whiffs from the
half-open window cut the close atmosphere.
Slowly, and with frequent halts for the passage
of war freights more urgent than ourselves,
our train chugged northward. One
hour, two hours, three hours of stuffy dimness
and acute discomfort. Finally I sank
into a troubled doze. When we were called
outside Boulogne, I found my hand poised
on the stout major's bald head, as if in
benediction.</p>

<p>The soldier on leave, eager to be done
with the preliminary journey, chafes at inevitable
delay in Boulogne. Yet this largest
of channel ports, in its present state, can
show the casual passer-by much that is interesting.
It has become almost a new town
during the past three years. Formerly a
headquarters of pleasure, a fishing centre
and a principal port of call for Anglo-Continental
travel, it has been transformed into
an important military base. It is now wholly
of the war; the armies absorb everything
that it transfers from sea to railway, from
human fuel for war's blast-furnace to the
fish caught outside the harbour. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>multitude
of visitors from across the Channel is
larger than ever; but instead of Paris, the
Mediterranean, and the East, they are bound
for less attractive destinations&mdash;the muddy
battle-area and Kingdom Come.</p>

<p>The spirit of the place is altogether
changed. From time immemorial Boulogne
has included an English alloy in its French
composition, but prior to the war it shared
with other coastal resorts of France an outlook
of smiling carelessness. Superficially it
now seems more British than French, and,
partly by reason of this, it impresses one
as being severely business-like. The great
number of khaki travellers is rivalled by a
huge colony of khaki Base workers. Except
for a few matelots, French fishermen, and
the wharfside caf&eacute;s, there is nothing to distinguish
the quays from those of a British
port.</p>

<p>The blue-bloused porters who formerly met
one with volubility and the expectation of a
fabulous tip have given place to khakied orderlies,
the polite customs officials to old-soldier
myrmidons of the worried embarkation
officer. Store dumps with English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>markings are packed symmetrically on the
cobbled stones. The transport lorries are all
British, some of them still branded with
the names of well-known London firms.
Newly-built supply dep&ocirc;ts, canteens, and
military institutes fringe the town proper or
rise behind the sand-ridges. One-time hotels
and casinos along the sea-front between
Boulogne and Wimereux have become hospitals,
to which, by day and by night, the
smooth-running motor ambulances bring
broken soldiers. Other of the larger hotels,
like the Folkestone and the Meurice, are
now patronised almost exclusively by British
officers.</p>

<p>The military note dominates everything.
A walk through the main streets leaves an
impression of mixed uniforms&mdash;bedraggled
uniforms from trench and dug-out, neat rainbow-tabbed
uniforms worn by officers attached
to the Base, graceful nursing uniforms,
haphazard convalescent uniforms, discoloured
blue uniforms of French permissionaires.
Everybody is bilingual, speaking, if not both
English and French, either one or other of
these languages and the formless Angliche
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>patois invented by Tommy and his hosts of
the occupied zone. And everybody, soldier
and civilian, treats as a matter of course the
strange metamorphosis of what was formerly
a haven for the gentle tourist.</p>

<p>The boat, due to steam off at eleven, left
at noon,&mdash;a creditable performance as leave-boats
go. On this occasion there was good
reason for the delay, as we ceded the right
of way to a hospital ship and waited while
a procession of ambulance cars drove along
the quay and unloaded their stretcher cases.
The Red Cross vessel churned slowly out of
the harbour, and we followed at a respectful
distance.</p>

<p>Passengers on a Channel leave-boat are
quieter than might be expected. With the
country of war behind them they have attained
the third degree of content, and so
novel is this state after months of living on
edge that the short crossing does not allow
sufficient time for them to be moved to exuberance.
One promenades the crowded
deck happily, taking care not to tread on
the staff spurs, and talks of fighting as if it
were a thing of the half-forgotten past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>But there is no demonstration. In a well-known
illustrated weekly a recent frontispiece,
supposedly drawn "from material supplied,"
depicts a band of beaming Tommies,
with weird water-bottles, haversacks, mess-tins,
and whatnots dangling from their sheepskin
coats, throwing caps and cheers high into
the air as they greet the cliffs of England. As
the subject of an Academy picture, or an
illustration for "The Hero's Homecoming, or
How a Bigamist Made Good," the sketch
would be excellent. But, except for the
beaming faces, it is fanciful. A shadowy
view of the English coast-line draws a crowd
to the starboard side of the boat, whence one
gazes long and joyfully at the dainty cliffs.
Yet there is no outward sign of excitement;
the deep satisfaction felt by all is of too
intimate a nature to call for cheering and
cap-throwing. The starboard deck remains
crowded as the shore looms larger, and until,
on entry into Dovstone harbour, one prepares
for disembarkation.</p>

<p>The Front seemed very remote from the
train that carried us from Dovstone to London.
How could one think of the wilderness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>with the bright hop-fields of Kent chasing
past the windows? Then came the mass-meeting
of brick houses that skirt London,
and finally the tunnel which is the approach
to the terminus. As the wheels rumbled
through the darkness of it they suggested
some lines of stray verse beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Twenty to eleven by all the clocks of Piccadilly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buy your love a lily-bloom, buy your love a rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It had been raining, and the faint yet unmistakable
tang sniffed from wet London
streets made one feel at home more than
anything else. We dispersed, each to make
his interval of heaven according to taste,
means, and circumstances. That same evening
I was fortunate in being helped to forget
the realities of war by two experiences.
A much-mustached A.P.M. threatened me
with divers penalties for the wearing of a
soft hat; and I was present at a merry gathering
of theatrical luminaries, enormously interested
in themselves, but enormously bored
by the war, which usurped so much newspaper
space that belonged by rights to the
lighter drama.</p>

<p>Curtain and interval of ten days, at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>end of which I was offered a place as passenger
in a machine destined for my own
squadron. The bus was to be taken to an
aircraft dep&ocirc;t in France from Rafborough
Aerodrome. Rafborough is a small town galvanised
into importance by its association
with flying. Years ago, in the far-away days
when aviation itself was matter for wonder,
the pioneers who concerned themselves with
the possibilities of war flying made their
headquarters at Rafborough. An experimental
factory, rich in theory, was established,
and near it was laid out an aerodrome for the
more practical work. Thousands of machines
have since been tested on the rough-grassed
aerodrome, while the neighbouring Royal Aircraft
Factory has continued to produce designs,
ideas, aeroplanes, engines, and aircraft
accessories. Formerly most types of new machines
were put through their official paces at
Rafborough, and most types, including some
captures from the Huns, were to be seen in
its sheds. Probably Rafborough has harboured
a larger variety of aircraft and aircraft
experts than any other place in the
world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>My friend the ferry-pilot having announced
that the carriage waited, I strapped our baggage,
some new gramophone records, and myself
into the observer's office. I also took&mdash;tell
this not in Gath, for the transport of
dogs by aeroplane has been forbidden&mdash;a
terrier pup sent to a fellow-officer by his
family. At first the puppy was on a cord
attached to some bracing-wires; but as he
showed fright when the machine took off
from the ground, I kept him on my lap for
a time. Here he remained subdued and apparently
uninterested. Later, becoming inured
to the engine's drone and the slight
vibration, he roused himself and wanted to
explore the narrowing passage toward the
tail-end of the fuselage. The little chap was,
however, distinctly pleased to be on land
again at Saint Gregoire, where he kept well
away from the machine, as if uncertain
whether the strange giant of an animal were
friendly or a dog-eater.</p>

<p>It was a morning lovely enough to be that
of the world's birthday. Not a cloud flecked
the sky, the flawless blue of which was made
tenuous by sunlight. The sun brightened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>the kaleidoscopic earthscape below us, so that
rivers and canals looked like quicksilver
threads, and even the railway lines glistened.
The summer countryside, as viewed from an
aeroplane, is to my mind the finest scene in
the world&mdash;an unexampled scene, of which
poets will sing in the coming days of universal
flight. The varying browns and greens of
the field-pattern merge into one another delicately;
the woods, splashes of bottle-green,
relieve the patchwork of hedge from too
ordered a scheme; rivers and roads criss-cross
in riotous manner over the vast tapestry;
pleasant villages and farm buildings
snuggle in the valleys or straggle on the
slopes. The wide and changing perspective
is full of a harmony unspoiled by the jarring
notes evident on solid ground. Ugliness and
dirt are camouflaged by the clean top of
everything. Grimy towns and jerry-built
suburbs seem almost attractive when seen
in mass from a height. Slums, the dead
uniformity of long rows of houses, sordid
back-gardens, bourgeois public statues&mdash;all
these eyesores are mercifully hidden by the
roofed surface. The very factory chimneys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>have a certain air of impressiveness, in common
with church towers and the higher
buildings. Once, on flying over the pottery
town of Coalport&mdash;the most uninviting place
I have ever visited&mdash;I found that the altered
perspective made it look delightful.</p>

<p>A westward course, with the fringe of
London away on our left, brought us to the
coast-line all too soon. Passing Dovstone,
the bus continued across the Channel. A
few ships, tiny and slow-moving when observed
from a machine at 8000 feet and travelling
100 miles an hour, spotted the sea. A
cluster of what were probably destroyers
threw out trails of dark smoke. From above
mid-Channel we could see plainly the two
coasts&mdash;that of England knotted into small
creeks and capes, that of France bent into
large curves, except for the sharp corner at
Grisnez. Behind was Blighty, with its greatness
and its&mdash;sawdust. Ahead was the province
of battle, with its good-fellowship and
its&mdash;mud. I lifted the puppy to show him
his new country, but he merely exhibited
boredom and a dislike of the sudden rush of
air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>From Cape Grisnez we steered north-east
towards Calais, so as to have a clearly defined
course to the aircraft dep&ocirc;t of Saint
Gregoire. After a cross-Channel flight one
notes a marked difference between the French
and English earthscapes. The French towns
and villages seem to sprawl less than those
of England, and the countryside in general
is more compact and regular. The roads are
straight and tree-bordered, so that they form
almost as good a guide to an airman as the
railways. In England the roads twist and
twirl through each other like the threads of
a spider's web, and failing rail or river or
prominent landmarks, one usually steers by
compass rather than trust to roads.</p>

<p>At Calais we turned to the right and followed
a network of canals south-westward to
Saint Gregoire, where was an aircraft dep&ocirc;t
similar to the one at Rafborough. New machines
call at Saint Gregoire before passing to
the service of aerodromes, and in its workshops
machines damaged but repairable are
made fit for further service. It is also a
higher training centre for airmen. Before
they join a squadron pilots fresh from their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>instruction in England gain experience on
service machines belonging to the "pool" at
Saint Gregoire.</p>

<p>Having been told by telephone from my
squadron that one of our pilots had been
detailed to take the recently arrived bus to
the Somme, I awaited his arrival and passed
the time to good purpose in watching the
aerobatics and sham fights of the pool pupils.
Every now and then another plane from
England would arrive high over the aerodrome,
spiral down and land into the wind.
The ferry-pilot who had brought me left for
Rafborough almost immediately on a much-flown
"quirk." The machine he had delivered
at Saint Gregoire was handed over to
a pilot from Umpty Squadron when the latter
reported, and we took to the air soon after
lunch. The puppy travelled by road over
the last lap of his long journey, in the company
of a lorry driver.</p>

<p>The bus headed east while climbing, for
we had decided to follow the British lines
as far as the Somme, a course which would
be prolific in interesting sights, and which
would make us eligible for that rare gift of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>the gods, an air-fight over friendly territory.</p>

<p>The coloured panorama below gave place
gradually to a wilderness&mdash;ugly brown and
pock-marked. The roads became bare and
dented, the fields were mottled by shell-holes,
the woods looked like scraggy patches
of burnt furze. It was a district of great
deeds and glorious deaths&mdash;the desolation
surrounding the Fronts of yesterday and
to-day.</p>

<p>North of Ypres we turned to the right
and hovered awhile over this city of ghosts.
Seen from above, the shell of the ancient
city suggests a grim reflection on the mutability
of beauty. I sought a comparison,
and could think of nothing but the skeleton
of a once charming woman. The ruins stood
out in a magnificent disorder that was starkly
impressive. Walls without roof, buildings
with two sides, churches without tower, were
everywhere prominent, as though proud to
survive the orgy of destruction. The shattered
Cathedral retained much of its former
grandeur. Only the old Cloth Hall, half-razed
and without arch or belfry, seemed to
cry for vengeance on the vandalism that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>wrecked it. The gaping skeleton was grey-white,
as if sprinkled by the powder of decay.
And one fancies that at night-time the ghosts
of 1915 mingle with the ghosts of Philip of
Spain's era of conquest and the ghosts of
great days in other centuries, as they search
the ruins for relics of the city they knew.</p>

<p>Left of us was the salient, studded with
broken villages that became household names
during the two epic Battles of Ypres. The
brown soil was dirty, shell-ploughed, and altogether
unlovely. Those strange markings,
which from our height looked like the tortuous
pathways of a serpent, were the
trenches, old and new, front-line, support,
and communication. Small saps projected
from the long lines at every angle. So complicated
was the jumble that the sinister
region of No Man's Land, with its shell-holes,
dead bodies, and barbed wire, was
scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>A brown strip enclosed the trenches and
wound northward and southward. Its surface
had been torn and battered by innumerable
shells. On its fringe, among the
copses and crests, were the guns, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>these were evidenced only by an occasional
flash. Behind, in front, and around them
were those links in the chain of war, the oft-cut
telephone wires. The desolation seemed
utterly bare, though one knew that over and
under it, hidden from eyes in the air, swarmed
the slaves of the gun, the rifle, and the bomb.</p>

<p>Following the belt of wilderness southward,
we were obliged to veer to the right
at St. Eloi, so as to round a sharp bend.
Below the bend, and on the wrong side of
it, was the Messines Ridge, the recent capture
of which has straightened the line as
far as Hooge, and flattened the Ypres salient
out of existence as a salient. Next came the
torn and desolate outline of Plug Street
Wood, and with it reminiscences of a splendid
struggle against odds when shell-shortage
hampered our 1915 armies. Armenti&egrave;res appeared
still worthy to be called a town. It
was battered, but much less so than Ypres,
possibly because it was a hotbed of German
espionage until last year. The triangular
denseness of Lille loomed up from the flat
soil on our left.</p>

<p>As we passed down the line the brown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>band narrowed until it seemed a strip of
discoloured water-marked ribbon sewn over
the mosaic of open country. The trench-lines
were monotonous in their sameness.
The shell-spotted area bulged at places, as
for example Festubert, Neuve Chapelle (of
bitter memory), Givenchy, Hulluch, and
Loos. Lens, well behind the German trenches
in those days, showed few marks of bombardment.
The ribbon of ugliness widened
again between Souchez and the yet uncaptured
Vimy Ridge, but afterwards contracted
as far as Arras, that ragged sentinel of the
war frontier.</p>

<p>At Arras we entered our own particular
province, which, after months of flying over
it, I knew better than my native county.
Gun-flashes became numerous, kite balloons
hung motionless, and we met restless aeroplane
formations engaged on defensive patrols.
With these latter on guard our chance
of a scrap with roving enemy craft would
have been remote; though for that matter
neither we nor they saw a single black-crossed
machine throughout the afternoon.</p>

<p>From Gommecourt to the Somme was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>area of concentrated destruction. The wilderness
swelled outwards, becoming twelve
miles wide at parts. Tens of thousands of
shells had pocked the dirty soil, scores of
mine explosions had cratered it. Only the
pen of a Zola could describe adequately the
zone's intense desolation, as seen from the
air. Those ruins, suggestive of abandoned
scrap-heaps, were formerly villages. They
had been made familiar to the world through
matter-of-fact reports of attack and counter-attack,
capture and recapture. Each had a
tale to tell of systematic bombardment, of
crumbling walls, of wild hand-to-hand fighting,
of sudden evacuation and occupation.
Now they were nothing but useless piles of
brick and glorious names&mdash;Thiepval, Pozi&egrave;res,
La Boiselle, Guillemont, Flers, Hardecourt,
Guinchy, Combles, Bouchavesnes, and a
dozen others.</p>

<p>Of all the crumbled roads the most striking
was the long, straight one joining Albert
and Bapaume. It looked fairly regular for
the most part, except where the trenches cut
it. Beyond the scrap-heap that once was
Pozi&egrave;res two enormous quarries dipped into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>the earth on either side of the road. Until
the Messines explosion they were the largest
mine craters on the western front. Farther
along the road was the scene of the first
tank raids, where on September 16 the metal
monsters waddled across to the gaping enemy
and ate up his pet machine-gun emplacements
before he had time to recover from
his surprise. At the road's end was the forlorn
stronghold of Bapaume. One by one
the lines of defence before it had been stormed,
and it was obvious that the town must fall,
though its capture was delayed until months
later by a fierce defence at the Butte de
Warlencourt and elsewhere. The advance towards
Bapaume was of special interest to
R.F.C. squadrons on the Somme, for the
town had been a troublesome centre of anti-aircraft
devilries. Our field-guns now being
too close for Herr Archie, he had moved to
more comfortable headquarters.</p>

<p>Some eight miles east of Bapaume the
Bois d'Havrincourt stood out noticeably.
Around old Mossy-Face, as the wood was
known in R.F.C. messes, were clustered many
Boche aerodromes. Innumerable duels had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>been fought in the air-country between
Mossy-Face and the lines. Every fine day
the dwellers in the trenches before Bapaume
saw machines swerving round each other in
determined effort to destroy. This region
was the hunting-ground of many dead notabilities
of the air, including the Fokker stars
Boelcke and Immelmann, besides British
pilots as brilliant but less advertised.</p>

<p>Below the Pozi&egrave;res-Bapaume road were five
small woods, grouped like the Great Bear
constellation of stars. Their roots were feeding
on hundreds of dead bodies, after each
of the five&mdash;Trones, Mametz, Foureaux, Delville,
and Bouleaux&mdash;had seen wild encounters
with bomb and bayonet beneath its dead
trees. Almost in the same position relative
to the cluster of woods as is the North Star
to the Great Bear, was a scrap-heap larger
than most, amid a few walls yet upright.
This was all that remained of the fortress of
Combles. For two years the enemy strengthened
it by every means known to military
science, after which the British and French
rushed in from opposite sides and met in
the main street.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>A few minutes down the line brought our
machine to the sparkling Somme, the white
town of P&eacute;ronne, and the then junction of
the British and French lines. We turned
north-west and made for home. Passing over
some lazy sausage balloons, we reached Albert.
Freed at last from the intermittent shelling
from which it suffered for so long, the town was
picking up the threads of activity. The
sidings were full of trucks, and a procession
of some twenty lorries moved slowly up the
road to Bouzincourt. As reminder of anxious
days, we noted a few skeleton roofs, and the
giant Virgin Mary in tarnished gilt, who,
after withstanding bombardments sufficient
to have wrecked a cathedral, leaned over at
right angles to her pedestal, suspended in apparently
miraculous fashion by the three remaining
girders.</p>

<p>We flew once more over a countryside of
multi-coloured crops and fantastic woods, and
so to the aerodrome.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Snatches of familiar flying-talk, unheard
during the past ten days of leave, floated
from the tea-table as I entered the mess:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>"Folded up as he pulled out of the dive&mdash;weak
factor of safety&mdash;side-slipped away from
Archie&mdash;vertical gust&mdash;choked on the fine
adjustment&mdash;made rings round the Hun&mdash;went
down in flames near Douai."</p>

<p>The machine that "went down in flames
near Douai" was piloted by the man whose
puppy I had brought from England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h2>A CLOUD RECONNAISSANCE.</h2>
<br />

<p>Clouds, say the text-books of meteorology,
are collections of partly condensed water
vapour or of fine ice crystals. Clouds, mentioned
in terms of the newspaper and the
club, are dingy masses of nebulousness under
which the dubious politician, company promoter,
or other merchant of hot air is hidden
from open attack and exposure. Clouds, to
the flying officer on active service, are either
useful friends or unstrafeable enemies. The
hostile clouds are very high and of the ice-crystal
variety. They form a light background,
against which aeroplanes are boldly
silhouetted, to the great advantage of anti-aircraft
gunners. The friendly or water-vapour
clouds are to be found several thousands of
feet lower. If a pilot be above them they
help him to dodge writs for trespass, which
Archibald the bailiff seeks to hand him.
When numerous enough to make attempts
at observation ineffective, they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>perform
an even greater service for him&mdash;that
of arranging for a day's holiday. And at
times the R.F.C. pilot, like the man with a
murky past, is constrained to have clouds
for a covering against attack; as you shall
see if you will accompany me on the trip
about to be described.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The period is the latter half of September,
1916, a time of great doings on the Somme
front. After a few weeks of comparative
inaction&mdash;if methodical consolidation and intense
artillery preparation can be called inaction&mdash;the
British are once more denting
the Boche line. Flers, Martinpuich, Courcelette,
and Eaucourt l'Abbaye have fallen
within the past week, and the tanks have
made their first ungainly bow before
the curtain of war, with the superlatives of
the war correspondent in close attendance.
Leave from France has been cancelled indefinitely.</p>

<p>Our orders are to carry through all the
reconnaissance work allotted to us, even
though weather conditions place such duties
near the border-line of possible <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>accomplishment.
That is why we now propose to leave
the aerodrome, despite a great lake of cloud
that only allows the sky to be seen through
rare gaps, and a sixty-mile wind that will
fight us on the outward journey. Under these
circumstances we shall probably find no
friendly craft east of the trenches, and, as a
consequence, whatever Hun machines are in
the air will be free to deal with our party.
However, since six machines are detailed for
the job, I console myself with the old tag
about safety in numbers.</p>

<p>We rise to a height of 3000 feet, and rendezvous
there. From the flight-commander's
bus I look back to see how the formation is
shaping, and discover that we number but
five, one machine having failed to start by
reason of a dud engine. We circle the aerodrome,
waiting for a sixth bus, but nobody
is sent to join us. The "Carry on" signal
shows up from the ground, and we head
eastward.</p>

<p>After climbing another fifteen hundred feet,
we enter the clouds. It is now impossible to
see more than a yard or two through the
intangible wisps of grey-white vapour that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>seem to float around us, so that our formation
loses its symmetry, and we become
scattered. Arrived in the clear atmosphere
above the clouds my pilot throttles down
until the rear machines have appeared and
re-formed. We then continue in the direction
of the trenches, with deep blue infinity
above and the unwieldy cloud-banks below.
Familiar landmarks show up from time to
time through holes in the white screen.</p>

<p>Against the violent wind, far stronger than
we found it near the ground, we make laboured
progress. Evidently, two of the formation
are in difficulties, for they drop
farther and farther behind. Soon one gives
in and turns back, the pilot being unable
to maintain pressure for his petrol supply.
I shout the news through the speaking-tube,
and hear, in reply from the flight-commander,
a muffled comment, which might be "Well!"
but it is more likely to be something else.
Three minutes later the second bus in trouble
turns tail. Its engine has been missing on
one cylinder since the start, and is not in a
fit state for a trip over enemy country. Again
I call to the leader, and again hear a word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>ending in "ell." The two remaining machines
close up, and we continue. Very suddenly
one of them drops out, with a rocker-arm
gone. Its nose goes down, and it glides
into the clouds. Yet again I call the flight-commander's
attention to our dwindling numbers,
and this time I cannot mistake the
single-syllabled reply. It is a full-throated
"Hell!"</p>

<p>For my part I compare the party to the
ten little nigger boys, and wonder when the
only survivor, apart from our own machine,
will leave. I look towards it anxiously. The
wings on one side are much lighter than
those on the other, and I therefore recognise
it as the Tripehound's bus. There is ground
for misgiving, for on several occasions during
the past ten minutes it has seemed to fly in
an erratic manner. The cause of this, as we
find out on our return, is that for five minutes
the Tripehound has been leaning over
the side, with the joystick held between his
knees while attempting to fasten a small door
in the cowling round the engine, left open
by a careless mechanic. It is important to
shut the opening, as otherwise the wind may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>rush inside and tear off the cowling. Just
as a short band of the trench line south of
Arras can be seen through a gap, the Tripehound,
having found that he cannot possibly
reach far enough to close the protruding door,
signals that he must go home.</p>

<p>I do not feel altogether sorry to see our
last companion leave, as we have often been
told not to cross the lines on a reconnaissance
flight with less than three machines;
and with the wind and the low clouds, which
now form an opaque window, perforated here
and there by small holes, a long observation
journey over Bocheland by a single
aeroplane does not seem worth while. But
the flight-commander, remembering the recent
order about completing a reconnaissance
at all costs, thinks differently and decides to
go on. To get our bearings he holds down
the nose of the machine until we have descended
beneath the clouds, and into full
view of the open country.</p>

<p>We find ourselves a mile or two beyond
Arras. As soon as the bus appears it is
bracketed in front, behind, and on both sides
by black shell-bursts. We swerve aside, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>more shells quickly follow. The shooting is
particularly good, for the Archie people have
the exact range of the low clouds slightly
above us. Three times we hear the hiss of
flying fragments of high explosive, and the
lower left plane is unevenly punctured. We
lose height for a second to gather speed, and
then, to my relief, the pilot zooms up to a
cloud. Although the gunners can no longer
see their target, they loose off a few more
rounds and trust to luck that a stray shell
may find us. These bursts are mostly far
wide of the mark, although two of them
make ugly black blotches against the whiteness
of the vapour through which we are
rising.</p>

<p>Once more we emerge into the open space
between sky and cloud. The flight-commander
takes the mouthpiece of his telephone
tube and shouts to me that he intends completing
the round above the clouds. To let
me search for railway and other traffic he
will descend into view of the ground at the
most important points. He now sets a compass
course for Toutpr&egrave;s, the first large town
of the reconnaissance, while I search all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>around for possible enemies. At present the
sky is clear, but at any minute enemy police
craft may appear from the unbroken blue or
rise through the clouds.</p>

<p>The slowness of our ground speed, due to
the fierce wind, allows me plenty of time to
admire the strangely beautiful surroundings.
Above is the inverted bowl of blue, bright
for the most part, but duller towards the
horizon-rim. The sun pours down a vivid
light, which spreads quicksilver iridescence
over the cloud-tops. Below is the cloud-scape,
fantastic and far-stretching. The
shadow of our machine is surrounded by
a halo of sunshine as it darts along the irregular
white surface. The clouds dip, climb,
twist, and flatten into every conceivable
shape. Thrown together as they never could
be on solid earth are outlines of the wildest
and tamest features of a world unspoiled by
battlefield, brick towns, ruins, or other ulcers
on the face of nature. Jagged mountains,
forests, dainty hills, waterfalls, heavy seas,
plateaux, precipices, quiet lakes, rolling plains,
caverns, chasms, and dead deserts merge into
one another, all in a uniform white, as though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>wrapped in cotton wool and laid out for
inspection in haphazard continuity. And
yet, for all its mad irregularity, the cloud-scape
from above is perfectly harmonious
and never tiring. One wants to land on the
clean surface and explore the jungled continent.
Sometimes, when passing a high projection,
the impulse comes to lean over and
grab a handful of the fleecy covering.</p>

<p>After being shut off from the ground for a
quarter of an hour, we are able to look down
through a large chasm. Two parallel canals
cut across it, and these we take to be part
of the canal junction below Toutpr&egrave;s. This
agrees with our estimate of speed, wind,
and time, according to which we should be
near the town. The pilot takes the machine
through the clouds, and we descend a few
hundred feet below them.</p>

<p>To disconcert Archie we travel in zigzags,
while I search for items of interest. A train
is moving south, and another is entering
Toutpr&egrave;s from the east. A few barges are
dotted among the various canals. Bordering
a wood to the west is an aerodrome. About
a dozen aeroplanes are in line on the ground,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>but the air above it is empty of Boche craft.</p>

<p>Evidently the Huns below had not expected
a visit from hostile machines on such
a day, for Archie allows several minutes to
pass before introducing himself. A black
puff then appears on our level some distance
ahead. We change direction, but the gunners
find our new position and send bursts
all round the bus. The single <i>wouff</i> of the
first shot has become a jerky chorus that
swells or dwindles according to the number
of shells and their nearness.</p>

<p>I signal to the flight-commander that I
have finished with Toutpr&egrave;s, whereupon we
climb into the clouds and comparative safety.
We rise above the white intangibility and
steer north-east, in the direction of Passementerie.
I continue to look for possible
aggressors. The necessity for a careful look-out
is shown when a group of black specks
appears away to the south, some fifteen hundred
feet above us. In this area and under
to-day's weather conditions, the odds are a
hundred to one that they will prove to be
Boches.</p>

<p>We lose height until our bus is on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>fringe of the clouds and ready to escape
out of sight. Apparently the newcomers do
not spot us in the first place, for they are
flying transverse to our line of flight. A few
minutes later they make the discovery, turn
in our direction, and begin a concerted dive.
All this while I have kept my field-glasses
trained on them, and as one machine turns
I can see the Maltese crosses painted on the
wings. The question of the strangers' nationality
being answered, we slip into a cloud
to avoid attack.</p>

<p>The flight-commander thinks it advisable
to remain hidden by keeping inside the clouds.
He must therefore steer entirely by compass,
without sun or landmark to guide him. As
we leave the clear air a left movement of the
rudder, without corresponding bank, swings
the machine to the north, so that its nose
points away from the desired course. The
pilot puts on a fraction of right rudder to
counteract the deviation. We veer eastward,
but rather too much, if the swaying
needle of the compass is to be believed. A
little left rudder again puts the needle into
an anti-clockwise motion. With his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>attention
concentrated on our direction, the pilot,
impatient at waiting for the needle to become
steady, unconsciously kicks the rudder-controls,
first to one side, then to the other.
The needle begins to swing around, and the
compass is thus rendered useless for the time
being. For the next minute or two, until it
is safe to leave the clouds, the pilot must
now keep the machine straight by instinct,
and trust to his sense of direction.</p>

<p>A similar mishap often happens when flying
through cloud. Pilots have been known
to declare that all compasses are liable to
swing of their own accord when in clouds,
though the real explanation is probably that
they themselves have disturbed the needle
unduly by a continuous pressure on each
side of the rudder-bar in turn, thus causing
an oscillation of the rudder and a consequent
zigzagged line of flight. The trouble is more
serious than it would seem to the layman,
as when the compass is out of action, and
no other guides are available, one tends to
drift round in a large circle, like a man lost
in the jungle. Should the craft be driven
by a rotary engine, the torque, or outward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>wash from the propeller, may make a machine
edge more and more to the left, unless
the pilot is careful to allow for this tendency.</p>

<p>Such a drift to the left has taken us well
to the north of a straight line between Toutpr&egrave;s
and Passementerie, as we discover on
leaving the clouds for a second or two, so
as to correct the error with the aid of landmarks.
But the compass has again settled
down to good behaviour, and we are able
to get a true course before we climb back
to the sheltering whiteness.</p>

<p>A flight inside the clouds is far from
pleasant. We are hemmed in by a drifting
formlessness that looks like thin steam, but,
unlike steam, imparts a sensation of coldness
and clamminess. The eye cannot penetrate
farther than about a yard beyond the wing
tips. Nothing is to be seen but the aeroplane,
nothing is to be heard but the droning
hum of the engine, which seems louder than
ever amid the isolation.</p>

<p>I am bored, cold, and uncomfortable. Time
drags along lamely; five minutes masquerade
as half an hour, and only by repeated glances
at the watch do I convince myself that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>cannot yet have reached the next objective.
I study the map for no particular reason
except that it is something to do. Then I
decide that the Lewis gun ought to be fired
as a test whether the working parts are still
in good order. I hold the spade-grip, swing
round the circular mounting until the gun
points to the side, and loose five rounds
into the unpleasant vapour. The flight-commander,
startled at the sudden clatter, turns
round. Finding that the fire was mine and
not an enemy's, he shakes his fist as a protest
against the sudden disturbance. Even
this action is welcome, as being evidence of
companionship.</p>

<p>When the pilot, judging that Passementerie
should be below, takes the machine
under the clouds, I feel an immense relief,
even though the exit is certain to make us
a target for Archie. We emerge slightly to
the west of the town. There is little to be
observed; the railways are bare of trains,
and the station contains only an average
number of trucks. Four black-crossed aeroplanes
are flying over their aerodrome at a
height of some two thousand feet. Three of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>them begin to climb, perhaps in an attempt
to intercept us. However, our bus has plenty
of time to disappear, and this we do quickly&mdash;so
quickly that the A.-A. batteries have
only worried us to the extent of half a dozen
shells, all wide of the mark.</p>

<p>We rise right through the white screen
into full view of the sun. Apparently the
sky is clear of intruders, so we turn for
three-quarters of a circle and head for Pluspr&egrave;s,
the third point of call. The wind now
being behind the machine in a diagonal direction,
our speed in relation to the ground
is twice the speed of the outward half of
the journey. The sun is pleasantly warming,
and I look towards it gratefully. A few small
marks, which may or may not be sun-spots,
flicker across its face. To get an easier view
I draw my goggles, the smoke-tinted glasses
of which allow me to look at the glare without
blinking. In a few seconds I am able
to recognise the spots as distant aeroplanes
moving in our direction. Probably they are
the formation that we encountered on the
way to Passementerie. Their object in keeping
between us and the sun is to remain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>unobserved with the help of the blinding
stream of light, which throws a haze around
them. I call the pilot's attention to the
scouts, and yet again we fade into the clouds.
This time, with the sixty-mile wind as our
friend, there is no need to remain hidden for
long. Quite soon we shall have to descend
to look at Pluspr&egrave;s, the most dangerous point
on the round.</p>

<p>When we take another look at earth I
find that the pilot has been exact in timing
our arrival at the important Boche base&mdash;too
exact, indeed, for we find ourselves directly
over the centre of the town. Only
somebody who has been Archied from Pluspr&egrave;s
can realise what it means to fly right
over the stronghold at four thousand feet.
The advanced lines of communication that
stretch westward to the Arras-P&eacute;ronne front
all hinge on Pluspr&egrave;s, and for this reason it
often shows activity of interest to the aeroplane
observer and his masters. The Germans
are therefore highly annoyed when
British aircraft arrive on a tour of inspection.
To voice their indignation they have concentrated
many anti-aircraft guns around the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>town. What is worse, the Archie fire at
Pluspr&egrave;s is more accurate than at any other
point away from the actual front, as witness
the close bracket formed by the sighting
shots that greet our solitary bus.</p>

<p>From a hasty glance at the station and
railway lines, while we slip away to another
level, I gather that many trains and much
rolling stock are to be bagged. The work
will have to be done under serious difficulties
in the shape of beastly black bursts and the
repeated changes of direction necessary to
dodge them. We bank sharply, side-slip, lose
height, regain it, and perform other erratic
evolutions likely to spoil the gunners' aim;
but the area is so closely sprinkled by shells
that, to whatever point the machine swerves,
we always hear the menacing report of bursting
H.E.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to observe accurately
while in my present condition of "wind up,"
created by the coughing of Archie. I lean
over to count the stationary trucks in the
sidings. "<i>Wouff</i>, <i>wouff</i>, <i>wouff</i>," interrupts
Archie from a spot deafeningly near; and I
withdraw into "the office," otherwise the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>observer's
cockpit. Follows a short lull, during
which I make another attempt to count the
abnormal amount of rolling stock. "<i>Wouff&mdash;Hs&mdash;sss!</i>"
shrieks another shell, as it throws
a large H.E. splinter past our tail. Again
I put my head in the office. I write down
an approximate estimate of the number of
trucks, and no longer attempt to sort them
out, so many to a potential train. A hunt
over the railway system reveals no fewer
than twelve trains. These I pencil-point on
my map, as far as I am able to locate them.</p>

<p>A massed collection of vehicles remain stationary
in what must be either a large square
or the market-place. I attempt to count
them, but am stopped by a report louder
than any of the preceding ones. Next instant
I find myself pressed tightly against
the seat. The whole of the machine is lifted
about a hundred feet by the compression
from a shell that has exploded a few yards
beneath our undercarriage. I begin to wonder
whether all our troubles have been swept
away by a direct hit; but an examination of
the machine shows no damage beyond a
couple of rents in the fabric of the fuselage.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>That finishes my observation work for the
moment. Not with a court-martial as the
only alternative could I carry on the job
until we have left Archie's inferno of frightfulness.
The flight-commander is of the
same mind, and we nose into the clouds,
pursued to the last by the insistent smoke-puffs.</p>

<p>When the bus is once again flying between
sky and cloud, we begin to feel more at
home. No other craft come within range of
vision, so that without interruption we reach
Aucoin, the fourth railway junction to be
spied upon. The rolling stock there is scarcely
enough for two train-loads, and no active
trains can be spotted. We hover above the
town for a minute, and then leave for Boislens.</p>

<p>The machine now points westward and
homeward, and thus has the full benefit of
the wind, which accelerates our ground speed
to about a hundred and fifty miles an hour.
The gods take it into their heads to be kind,
for we are not obliged to descend through
the clouds over Boislens, as the region can
be seen plainly through a gap large enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>to let me count the R.S. and note that a
train, with steam up, stands in the station.</p>

<p>As Boislens is the last town mentioned by
the H.Q. people who mapped out the reconnaissance,
the job is all but completed. Yet
twelve miles still separate us from the
nearest bend of the trench line, and a twelve-mile
area contains plenty of room for a fight.
Since the open atmosphere shows no warning
of an attack, I look closely toward the
sun&mdash;for a fast scout will often try to surprise
a two-seater by approaching between
its quarry and the sun.</p>

<p>At first I am conscious of nothing but a
strong glare; but when my goggled eyes become
accustomed to the brightness, I see,
or imagine I see, an indistinct oblong object
surrounded by haze. I turn away for a
second to avoid the oppressive light. On
seeking the sun again I find the faint oblong
more pronounced. For one instant it deviates
from the straight line between our bus
and the sun, and I then recognise it as an
aeroplane. I also discover that a second
machine is hovering two thousand feet above
the first.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>The chief hobby of the flight-commander
is to seek a scrap. Immediately I make
known to him the presence of hostile craft
he tests his gun in readiness for a fight.
Knowing by experience that if he starts
man&oelig;uvring round a Hun he will not break
away while there is the slightest chance of a
victory, I remind him, by means of a note-book
leaf, that since our job is a reconnaissance,
the R.F.C. law is to return quickly
with our more or less valuable information,
and to abstain from such luxuries as unnecessary
fights, unless a chance can be seized
over British ground. Although he does not
seem too pleased at the reminder he puts
down the nose of the machine, so as to cross
the lines in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The first Hun scout continues the dive to
within three hundred yards, at which range
I fire a few short bursts, by way of an announcement
to the Boche that we are ready
for him and protected from the rear. He
flattens out and sits behind our tail at a
respectful distance, until the second scout
has joined him. The two separate and prepare
to swoop down one from each side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>But we are now passing the trenches, and
just as one of our attackers begins to dive,
a formation of de Havilands (British pusher
scouts) arrives to investigate. The second
Boche plants himself between us and the
newcomers, while his companion continues
to near until he is a hundred and fifty yards
from us. At this range I rattle through the
rest of the ammunition drum, and the Hun
swerves aside. We now recognise the machine
as an Albatross scout or "German
spad," a most successful type that only entered
the lists a fortnight beforehand. Finding
that they have to reckon with five
de Havilands, the two Huns turn sharply
and race eastward, their superior speed saving
them from pursuit.</p>

<p>We pass through the clouds for the last
time on the trip, and fly home very soberly,
while I piece together my hurried notes.
The Squadron Commander meets us in the
aerodrome with congratulations and a desire
for information.</p>

<p>"Seen anything?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Fourteen trains and some M.T.," I
reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>"And a few thousand clouds," adds the
flight-commander.</p>

<p>By the time I have returned from the
delivery of my report at G.H.Q., the wing
office has sent orders that we are to receive
a mild censure for carrying out a reconnaissance
with only one machine. The Squadron
Commander grins as he delivers the
reproof, so that we do not feel altogether
crushed.</p>

<p>"Don't do it again," he concludes.</p>

<p>As we have not the least desire to do it
again, the order is likely to be obeyed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h2>ENDS AND ODDS.</h2>
<br />

<p>As a highly irresponsible prophet I am convinced
that towards the end of the war
hostilities in the air will become as decisive
as hostilities on land or sea. An obvious
corollary is that the how and when of peace's
coming must be greatly influenced by the
respective progress, during the next two
years, of the belligerents' flying services.</p>

<p>This view is far less fantastic than the
whirlwind development of war-flying witnessed
by all of us since 1914. Indeed, to
anybody with a little imagination and some
knowledge of what is in preparation among
the designers and inventors of various countries,
that statement would seem more self-evident
than extreme. Even the average
spectator of aeronautical advance in the past
three years must see that if anything like
the same rate of growth be maintained, by
the end of 1918 aircraft numbered in tens
of thousands and with extraordinary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>capacities
for speed, climb, and attack will make
life a burden to ground troops, compromise
lines of communication, cause repeated havoc
to factories and strongholds, and promote
loss of balance among whatever civilian populations
come within range of their activity.</p>

<p>To emphasise the startling nature of aeronautical
expansion&mdash;past, present, and future&mdash;let
us trace briefly the progress of the
British Flying Corps from pre-war conditions
to their present state of high efficiency. When
the Haldane-Asquith brotherhood were caught
napping, the Flying Corps possessed a seventy
odd (very odd) aeroplanes, engined by
the unreliable Gnome and the low-powered
Renault. Fortunately it also possessed some
very able officers, and these succeeded at the
outset in making good use of doubtful material.
One result of the necessary reconstruction
was that a large section of the
original corps seceded to the Navy and the
remainder came under direct control of the
Army. The Royal Naval Air Service began
to specialise in bomb raids, while the Royal
Flying Corps (Military Wing) sent whatever
machines it could lay hands on to join the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>old contemptibles in France. Both services
proceeded to increase in size and importance
at break-neck speed.</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of the R.N.A.S. allowed
for a heavy surplus of men and machines
beyond the supply necessary for the
purely naval branch of the service. From
this force a number of squadrons went to
the Dardanelles, Africa, the Tigris, and other
subsidiary theatres of war; and an important
base was established at Dunkirk, whence
countless air attacks were made on all military
centres in Belgium. Many more R.N.A.S.
squadrons, well provided with trained
pilots and good machines, patrolled the East
Coast while waiting for an opportunity of
active service. This came early in 1917,
when, under the wise supervision of the
Air Board, the section of the Naval Air
Service not concerned with naval matters
was brought into close touch with the Royal
Flying Corps, after it had pursued a lone
trail for two years. The Flying Corps units
on the Western Front and elsewhere are now
splendidly backed by help from the sister
service. For the present purpose, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>the military efforts of the R.N.A.S. can be
included with those of the R.F.C., after a
tribute has been paid to the bombing offensives
for which the Naval Air Service has
always been famous, from early exploits with
distant objectives such as Cuxhaven and
Friedrichshafen to this year's successful attacks
on German munition works, in conjunction
with the French, and the countless
trips from Dunkirk that are making the Zeebrugge-Ostend-Bruges
sector such an unhappy
home-from-home for U-boats, destroyers, and
raiding aircraft. Meanwhile the seaplane
branch, about which little is heard, has
reached a high level of efficiency. When the
screen of secrecy is withdrawn from the
North Sea, we shall hear very excellent stories
of what the seaplanes have accomplished
lately in the way of scouting, chasing the
Zeppelin, and hunting the U-boat.</p>

<p>But from the nature of its purpose, the
R.F.C. has borne the major part of our
aerial burden during the war. In doing so,
it has grown from a tiny band of enthusiasts
and experimentalists to a great service which
can challenge comparison with any other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>branch of the Army. The history of this
attainment is intensely interesting.</p>

<p>The few dozen airmen who accompanied
the contemptible little army on the retreat
from Mons had no precedents from other
campaigns to guide them, and the somewhat
vague dictum that their function was
to gather information had to be interpreted
by pioneer methods. These were satisfactory
under the then conditions of warfare,
inasmuch as valuable information certainly
was gathered during the retreat, when a
blind move would have meant disaster,&mdash;how
valuable only the chiefs of the hard-pressed
force can say. This involved more
than the average difficulties, for as the battle
swayed back towards Paris new landing-grounds
had to be sought, and temporary
aerodromes improvised every few days. The
small collection of serviceable aeroplanes
again justified themselves at the decisive
stand in the Marne and Ourcq basin, where
immediate reports of enemy concentrations
were essential to victory. Again, after
the Hun had been swept across the Aisne
and was stretching north-eastward tentacles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>to clutch as much of the coast as was consonant
with an unbroken line, the aerial
spying out of the succeeding phases of retirement
was of great service. Indeed, tentative
though it was, the work of the British,
French, and German machines before the
advent of trench warfare proved how greatly
air reconnaissance would alter the whole perspective
of an open country campaign.</p>

<p>After the long barrier of trenches deadlocked
the chances of extended movement
and opened the dreary months of more or
less stationary warfare, the R.F.C. organisation
in France had time and space for
self-development. Aerodromes were selected
and erected, the older and less satisfactory
types of machine were replaced by the stable
B.E2.C., the active service squadrons were
reconstructed and multiplied.</p>

<p>To the observation of what happened behind
the actual front was added the mapping
of the enemy's intricate trench-mosaic. For
a month or two this was accomplished by
the methodical sketches of a few observers.
It was an exceedingly difficult task to trace
every trench and sap and to pattern the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>network from a height of about 2000 feet,
but the infantry found small ground for
dissatisfaction as regards the accuracy or
completeness of the observers' drawings.
Then came the introduction of aerial photography
on a large scale, and with it a complete
bird's-eye plan of all enemy defence
works, pieced together from a series of overhead
snapshots that reproduced the complete
trench-line, even to such details as
barbed wire. By the infallible revelations of
the camera, untricked by camouflage, concealed
gun positions were spotted for the
benefit of our artillery, and highly useful information
about likely objectives was provided
for the bombing craft.</p>

<p>The frequent bombing of German supply
centres in Belgium and North France came
into being with the development of aerial
photography. Owing to the difficulty of correct
aim, before the advent of modern bomb-sights,
all the early raids were carried out
from a low altitude, sometimes from only a
few hundred feet. For every purpose, moreover,
low altitudes were the rule in the earlier
months of the war, as most of the machines
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>would not climb above 4000-7000 feet. Much
of the observation was performed at something
between 1000 and 2000 feet, so that
aircraft often returned with a hundred or so
bullet-holes in them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the important work of artillery
spotting was being developed. New systems
of co-operation between artillery and aeroplanes
were devised, tested, and improved.
At first lamps or Very's lights were used to
signal code-corrections, but these were soon
replaced by wireless transmission from the
observation machine. Targets which could
not be ranged on through ground observation
posts became targets no longer, after one
shoot ranged from the air. As the number
of available aircraft increased, so did the
amount of observation for the guns, until
finally the entire front opposite the British
was registered for bombardment and divided
into sections covered by specified artillery
machines.</p>

<p>Aerial fighting, now so essential and scientific
a branch of modern war, was rudimentary
in 1914. Pilots and observers of the
original Flying Corps carried revolvers, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>many observers also equipped themselves with
rifles, but the aeroplanes were not fitted with
machine-guns. Such scraps as there were
consisted of one machine man&oelig;uvring round
an opponent at close quarters for the chance
of a well-aimed shot. Under these circumstances
to "bring down" or "drive down out
of control" an enemy was extremely difficult,
though a very gallant officer, since killed in
action, once killed two German pilots within
five minutes with his revolver.</p>

<p>Soon the possibilities of aerial machine-guns
were quickly recognised. The R.F.C.
adopted the Lewis, which from the points
of view of lightness and handiness was well
suited for aircraft, and the German airmen
countered with a modified Hotchkiss and
other types.</p>

<p>But the stable observation machines, while
excellent for reconnaissance and artillery spotting,
allowed their crews only a small arc of
fire, and not until the German single-seater
scouts and our Bristol scout, then a comparatively
fast machine, appeared on the
western front in the spring of 1915 did the
destruction of aeroplanes become an everyday
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>occurrence. With the introduction of scouts
for escort and protective duties came formation
flying and concerted attack.</p>

<p>Fighting craft continued to increase in
speed and numbers. As the struggle became
more and more intense, so did the scene of it
move higher and higher, prodded by an ever-growing
capacity for climb and the ever-growing
menace of the anti-aircraft guns.
The average air battle of to-day begins at
an altitude between 12,000 and 20,000 feet.</p>

<p>The conflict for mechanical superiority has
had its ebb and flow, and consequently of its
proportional casualties; but the British have
never once been turned from their programme
of observation. There have been critical
times, as for example when the Fokker
scourge of late 1915 and early 1916 laid low
so many of the observation craft. But the
Fokkers were satisfactorily dealt with by the
de Haviland and the F.E.8. pusher scouts and
the F.E. "battleplane," as the newspapers of
the period delighted to call it. Next the
pendulum swung towards the British, who
kept the whip hand during the summer and
autumn of last year. Even when the Boche
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>again made a bid for ascendancy with the
Halberstadt, the Roland, the improved L.V.G.,
and the modern Albatross scout, the
Flying Corps organisation kept the situation
well in hand, though the supply of faster
machines was complicated by the claims of
the R.N.A.S. squadrons in England.</p>

<p>Throughout the Somme Push we were able
to maintain that aerial superiority without
which a great offensive cannot succeed. This
was partly the result of good organisation
and partly of the fighting capabilities of the
men who piloted the Sopwith, the Nieuport,
the de Haviland, the F.E., and other 1916
planes which were continually at grips with
the Hun. The German airmen, with their
"travelling circuses" of twelve to fifteen fast
scouts, once more had an innings in the spring
of the current year, and the older types of
British machine were hard put to it to carry
through their regular work. Then came the
great day when scores of our new machines,
husbanded for the occasion, engaged the
enemy hell-for-leather at his own place in
the air. An untiring offensive was continued
by our patrols, and the temporary supremacy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>passed into British hands, where it very
definitely remains, and where, if the shadows
of coming events and the silhouettes of coming
machines materialise, it is likely to remain.</p>

<p>Judged on a basis of losses, the unceasing
struggle between aeroplane and aeroplane
would seem to have been fairly equal, though
it must be remembered that three-quarters
of the fighting has had for its <i>milieu</i> the
atmosphere above enemy territory. Judged
on a basis of the maintenance of adequate
observation, which is the primary object of
aerial attack and defence, the British have
won consistently. At no time has the R.F.C.
been obliged to modify its duties of reconnaissance,
artillery spotting, photography, or
co-operation with advancing infantry, which
was introduced successfully last summer. On
the contrary, each of these functions, together
with bombing and "ground stunts" from low
altitudes, has swollen to an abnormal extent.</p>

<p>An idea of the vastness of our aerial effort
on the British front in France can be gathered
from the R.F.C. work performed on a
typical "big push" day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Throughout the night preceding an advance,
several parties, laden with heavy
bombs, steer by compass to Hun headquarters
or other objectives, and return no
longer laden with bombs. The first streak
of daylight is the herald of an exodus from
west to east of many score fighting craft.
These cross the lines, hover among the
Archie bursts, and drive back or down all
black-crossed strangers within sight. Some
of them go farther afield and attack the
Boche above his own aerodromes. Such
enemy craft as manage to take the air without
meeting trouble from the advanced offensive
patrols are tackled by the scouts
near the lines. The few that travel still
farther eastward with the intention of swooping
on our observation machines, or of themselves
gathering information, receive a hearty
welcome from our defensive patrols.</p>

<p>The British two-seaters are thus free to
direct the artillery, link the attacking infantry
with headquarters, and spy out the
land. As soon as the early morning light
allows, a host of planes will be darting backward
and forward over the trench-line as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>they guide the terrific bombardment preliminary
to an attack. Other machines are
searching for new emplacements and signs of
preparation behind the enemy trenches. Several
formations carry out tactical reconnaissances
around an area stretching from the
lines to a radius twenty miles east of them,
and further parties perform strategic reconnaissance
by covering the railways, roads,
and canals that link the actual front with
bases thirty to ninety miles behind it. When,
at a scheduled time, the infantry emerge
over the top behind a curtain of shells, the
contact patrol buses follow their doings, inform
the gunners of any necessary modifications
in the barrage, or of some troublesome
nest of machine-guns, note the positions
held by the attackers, collect signals from
the battalion headquarters, and by means of
message bags dropped over brigade headquarters
report progress to the staff. If,
later, a further advance be made, the low-flying
contact machines again play their part
of mothering the infantry.</p>

<p>Machines fitted with cameras photograph
every inch of the defences improvised by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>the enemy, and, as insurance against being
caught unprepared by a counter-attack, an
immediate warning of whatever movement is
in evidence on the lines of communication
will be supplied by the reconnaissance observers.
Under the direction of artillery
squadrons the guns pound the new Boche
front line and range on troublesome batteries.</p>

<p>The bombing craft are responsible for onslaughts
on railways, supply dep&ocirc;ts, garrison
towns, headquarters, aerodromes, and chance
targets. Other guerilla work is done by
craft which, from a height of anything under
a thousand feet, machine-gun whatever worthwhile
objects they spot. A column of troops
on the march, transport, ammunition waggons,
a train, a stray motor-car&mdash;all these are
greeted joyfully by the pilots who specialise
in ground stunts. And at every hour of daylight
the scouts and fighting two-seaters protect
the remainder of the R.F.C. by engaging
all Huns who take to the air.</p>

<p>Doubtless, when sunset has brought the
roving birds back to their nest, there will be
a few "missing"; but this, part of the day's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>work, is a small enough sacrifice for the general
achievement&mdash;the staff supplied with
quick and accurate information, a hundred
or two Boche batteries silenced, important
works destroyed, enemy communications impeded,
a dozen or so black-crossed aeroplanes
brought down, valuable photographs and reports
obtained, and the ground-Hun of every
species harried.</p>

<p>The German Flying Corps cannot claim to
perform anything like the same amount of
aerial observation as its British counterpart.
It is mainly occupied in fighting air battles
and hampering the foreign machines that
spy on their army. To say that the German
machines are barred altogether from reconnaissance
and artillery direction would be
exaggeration, but not wild exaggeration.
Seldom can an enemy plane call and correct
artillery fire for longer than half an hour.
From time to time a fast machine makes a
reconnaissance tour at a great height, and
from time to time others dart across the
lines for photography, or to search for gun
positions. An appreciable proportion of these
do not return. Four-fifths of the Hun bomb
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>raids behind our front take place at night-time,
when comparative freedom from attack
is balanced by impossibility of accurate
aim. Apart from these spasmodic activities,
the German pilots concern themselves entirely
with attempts to prevent allied observation.
They have never yet succeeded, even
during the periods of their nearest approach
to the so-called "mastery of the air," and
probably they never will succeed. The advantages
attendant upon a maintenance of
thorough observation, while whittling down
the enemy's to a minimum, cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p>To determine how much credit for the
brilliant achievement I have tried to outline
belongs to the skill and adaptability of
British airmen, and how much to successful
organisation, would be difficult and rather
unnecessary. But it is obvious that those
who guided the R.F.C. from neglected beginnings
to the status of a great air service
had a tremendous task. Only the technical
mind can realise all that it has involved in the
production of trained personnel, aeroplanes,
engines, aircraft dep&ocirc;ts, aerodromes, wireless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>equipment, photographic workshops and accessories,
bombs, and a thousand and one
other necessaries.</p>

<p>Many thousand pilots have been trained
in all the branches of war flying. The number
of squadrons now in France would surprise
the layman if one were allowed to make
it public; while other squadrons have done
excellent work in Macedonia, Egypt, Mesopotamia,
East Africa, and elsewhere. Mention
must also be made of the Home Defence
groups, but for which wholesale Zeppelin
raids on the country would be of common
occurrence.</p>

<p>How to make best use of the vast personnel
in France is the business of the staff,
who link the fighting members of the corps
with the Intelligence Department and the
rest of the Army in the field. To them has
fallen the introduction and development of
the various functions of war aircraft, besides
the planning of bomb raids and concerted
aerial offensives. On the equipment side
there is an enormous wastage to be dealt
with, and consequently a constant cross-Channel
interchange of machines. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>amount of necessary replacement is made
specially heavy by the short life of effective
craft. A type of machine is good for a few
months of active service, just holds its own
for a few more, and then becomes obsolete
except as a training bus. To surpass or even
keep pace with the Boche Flying Corps on
the mechanical side, it has been necessary
for the supply department to do a brisk
trade in new ideas and designs, experiment,
improvement, and scrapping.</p>

<p>Although free-lance attacks by airmen on
whatever takes their fancy down below are
now common enough, they were unknown
little over a year ago. Their early history is
bound up with the introduction of contact
patrols, or co-operation with advancing infantry.
Previous to the Somme Push of
1916, communication during an attack between
infantry on the one hand and the guns
and various headquarters on the other was a
difficult problem. A battalion would go over
the top and disappear into the enemy lines.
It might have urgent need of reinforcements
or of a concentrated fire on some dangerous
spot. Yet to make known its wants quickly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>was by no means easy, for the telephone
wires were usually cut, carrier-pigeons went
astray, and runners were liable to be shot.
When the British introduced the "creeping
barrage" of artillery pounding, which moved
a little ahead of the infantry and curtained
them from machine-gun and rifle fire, the
need for rapid communication was greater
than ever. Exultant attackers would rush
forward in advance of the programmed speed
and be mown by their own barrage.</p>

<p>Credit for the trial use of the aeroplane to
link artillery with infantry belongs to the British,
though the French at Verdun first brought
the method to practical success. We then
developed the idea on the Somme with notable
results. Stable machines, equipped with
wireless transmitters and Klaxon horns, flew
at a low height over detailed sectors, observed
all developments, signalled back guidance for
the barrage, and by means of message bags
supplied headquarters with valuable information.
Besides its main purpose of mothering
the infantry, the new system of contact
patrols was found to be useful in dealing with
enemy movements directly behind the front
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>line. If the bud of a counter-attack appeared,
aeroplanes would call upon the guns to nip
it before it had time to blossom.</p>

<p>Last September we of the fighting and
reconnaissance squadrons began to hear interesting
yarns from the corps squadrons
that specialised in contact patrols. An observer
saved two battalions from extinction
by calling up reinforcements in the nick of
time. When two tanks slithered around the
ruins of Courcelette two hours before the
razed village was stormed, the men in the
trenches would have known nothing of this
unexpected advance-guard but for a contact
machine. The pilot and observer of another
bus saw two tanks converging eastward at
either end of a troublesome Boche trench. A
German officer, peering round a corner, drew
back quickly when he found one of the new
steel beasts advancing. He hurried to an
observation post round a bend in the lines.
Arrived there, he got the shock of his life
when he found a second metal monster
waddling towards him. Alarmed and unnerved,
he probably ordered a retirement,
for the trench was evacuated immediately.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>The observer in a watching aeroplane then
delivered a much-condensed synopsis of the
comedy to battalion headquarters, and the
trench was peacefully occupied.</p>

<p>Inevitably the nearness of the enemy to
machines hovering over a given area bred
in the airmen concerned a desire to swoop
down and panic the Boche. Movement in
a hostile trench was irresistible, and many
a pilot shot off his engine, glided across
the lines, and let his observer spray with
bullets the home of the Hun. The introduction
of such tactics was not planned beforehand
and carried out to order. It was
the outcome of a new set of circumstances
and almost unconscious enterprise. More
than any other aspect of war flying, it is, I
believe, this imminence of the unusual that
makes the average war pilot swear greatly
by his job, while other soldiers temper their
good work with grousing. His actions are
influenced by the knowledge that somewhere,
behind a ridge of clouds, in the nothingness
of space, on the patchwork ground, the True
Romance has hidden a new experience, which
can only be found by the venturer with alert
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>vision, a quick brain, and a fine instinct for
opportunity.</p>

<p>The free-lance ground stunt, then, had its
origin in the initiative of a few pilots who
recognised a chance, took it, and thus opened
yet another branch in the huge departmental
store of aerial tactics. The exploits of these
pioneers were sealed with the stamp of official
approval, and airmen on contact patrol
have since been encouraged to relieve
boredom by joyous pounces on Brother
Boche.</p>

<p>The star turn last year was performed by
a British machine that captured a trench.
The pilot guided it above the said trench
for some hundred yards, while the observer
emptied drum after drum of ammunition at
the crouching Germans. A headlong scramble
was followed by the appearance of an
irregular line of white billowings. The enemy
were waving handkerchiefs and strips of material
in token of surrender! Whereupon our
infantry were signalled to take possession,
which they did. Don't shrug your shoulders,
friend the reader, and say: "Quite a good
story, but tall, very tall." The facts were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>related in the R.F.C. section of 'Comic Cuts,'
otherwise G.H.Q. summary of work.</p>

<p>Fighting squadrons soon caught the craze
for ground stunts and carried it well beyond
the lines. One machine chased a train for
miles a few hundred feet above, derailed it,
and spat bullets at the lame coaches until
driven off by enemy craft. Another made
what was evidently an inspection of troops
by some Boche Olympian look like the riotous
disorder of a Futurist painting. A pilot
with some bombs to spare spiralled down over
a train, dropped the first bomb on the engine,
and the second, third, fourth, and fifth on the
soldiers who scurried from the carriages.
When a detachment of cavalry really did
break through for once in a while, it was
startled to find an aerial vanguard. A frolicsome
biplane darted ahead, pointed out positions
worthy of attack, and created a
diversion with Lewis gun fire.</p>

<p>At the end of a three-hour offensive patrol
my pilot would often descend our bus to
less than a thousand feet, cross No Man's
Land again, and zigzag over the enemy
trenches, where we disposed of surplus <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ammunition
to good purpose. On cloudy days,
with the pretext of testing a new machine
or a gun, he would fly just above the clouds,
until we were east of the lines, then turn
round and dive suddenly through the cloud-screen
in the direction of the Boche positions,
firing his front gun as we dropped. The turn
of my rear gun came afterwards when the
pilot flattened out and steered northward
along the wrong border of No Man's Land.
Once, when flying very low, we looked into a
wide trench and saw a group of tiny figures
make confused attempts to take cover, tumbling
over each other the while in ludicrous
confusion.</p>

<p>I remember a notable first trip across the
lines made by a pilot who had just arrived
from England. He had been sent up to
have a look at the battle line, with an old-hand
observer and instructions not to cross
the trenches. However, he went too far
east, and found himself ringed by Archie
bursts. These did not have their customary
effect on a novice of inspiring mortal funk,
for the new pilot became furiously angry
and flew Berserk. He dived towards <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>Bapaume,
dropped unscathed through the barrage
of anti-aircraft shelling for which this
stronghold was at the time notorious, fired a
hundred rounds into the town square from a
height of 800 feet, and raced back over the
Bapaume-Pozi&egrave;res road pursued by flaming
"onion" rockets. The observer recovered
from his surprise in time to loose off a drum
of ammunition at Bapaume, and three more
along the straight road to the front line, paying
special attention to the village of Le
Sars.</p>

<p>It was above this village that I once was
guilty of communicating with the enemy.
During a three-hours' offensive patrol around
the triangle&mdash;Bapaume-Mossy-Face Wood-Epehy&mdash;we
had not seen a single Hun machine.
Low clouds held Archie in check, and
there was therefore small necessity to swerve
from a straight course. Becoming bored, I
looked at the pleasant-seeming countryside
below, and reflected how ill its appearance
harmonised with its merits as a dwelling-place,
judged on the best possible evidence&mdash;the
half-hysterical diaries found on enemy
prisoners, the bitter outpourings anent the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>misery of intense bombardment and slaughter,
the ominous title "The Grave" given to the
region by Germans who had fought there.
An echo of light-hearted incursions into German
literature when I was a student at a
Boche college suggested that the opening lines
of Schiller's "Sehnsucht" were peculiarly apposite
to the state of mind of the Huns who
dwelt by the Somme. Wishing to share my
discovery, I wrote the verse in large block
capitals, ready to be dropped at a convenient
spot. I took the liberty of transposing three
pronouns from the first person to the second,
so as to apostrophise our Boche brethren.
The patrol finished, my pilot spiralled down
to within a 300-yard range of the ground and
flew along the road past Martinpuich, while
I pumped lead at anything that might be a
communication trench. We sprinkled Le Sars
with bullets, and there I threw overboard the
quotation from a great German poet, folded
inside an empty Very's cartridge to which I
had attached canvas streamers. If it was
picked up, I trust the following lines
were not regarded merely as wordy frightfulness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ach! aus dieses Thales Gr&uuml;nden<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Die der kalte Nebel dr&uuml;ckt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">K&ouml;nnt' ihr doch den Ausgang finden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ach! wie f&uuml;hlt' ihr euch begl&uuml;ekt!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of all the tabloid tales published last year
in R.P.C. 'Comic Cuts,' the most comic was
that of a mist, a British bus, and a Boche
General. The mist was troublesome; the bus,
homeward bound after a reconnaissance, was
flying low to keep a clear vision of the earth;
the general was seated in his dignified car,
after the manner of generals. The British
pilot dived on the car, the British observer
fired on the car, the Boche chauffeur stopped
the car, the Boche general jumped from the
car. Chauffeur and general rushed through a
field into a wood; pilot and observer went
home and laughed.</p>

<p>Thus far the facts are taken from the
official report. An appropriate supplement
was the rumour, which deserved to be true
but possibly wasn't, that the observer turned
in the direction of the vanished general and
plagiarised George Robey with a shout into
the unhearing air: "Cheeriho old thing, here's
a go, my hat, priceless!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>So much for past accomplishment. The
future of war flying, like all futures, is problematical;
but having regard to our present
unquestionable superiority in the air, and to
the blend of sane imagination and practical
ability now noticeable as an asset of the
flying services directorate, one can hazard the
statement that in the extended aerial war
which is coming the R.F.C. and R.N.A.S.
will nearly satisfy the most exacting of
critics.</p>

<p>The tendency is toward a rapid development
of aircraft even more startling than
that of the past. Some of the modern scout
machines have a level speed of 130-150 miles
an hour, and can climb more than 1000 feet
a minute until an abnormal height is reached.
It is certain that within a year later machines
will travel 160, 180, and 200 miles an hour
level. Quantity as well as quality is on the
up-grade, so that the power to strike hard
and far will increase enormously, helped by
heavier armament, highly destructive bombs,
and more accurate bomb-sights.</p>

<p>And, above all, we shall see a great extension
of ground attacks by air cavalry.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>The production of a machine specially adapted
for this purpose, armoured underneath, perhaps,
and carrying guns that fire downward
through the fuselage, is worth the careful attention
of aeroplane designers. It is probable
that with the reappearance of extended military
movement on the western front, as must
happen sooner or later, continuous guerilla
tactics by hundreds of low-flying aeroplanes
may well turn an orderly retirement into a
disorderly rout.</p>

<p>When and if a push of pushes really breaks
the German line, I fully expect that we of
the air service will lead the armies of pursuit
and make ourselves a pluperfect nuisance to
the armies of retreat. Temporary second lieutenants
may yet be given the chance to drive
a Boche general or two into the woods, or
even&mdash;who can limit the freaks of Providence?&mdash;plug
down shots at the Limelight Kaiser
himself, as he tours behind the front in his
favourite <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Bombastes Furioso.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h2>THE DAILY ROUND.</h2>
<br />

<p>During a bout of active service one happens
upon experiences that, though they make no
immediate impression, become more prominent
than the most dramatic events, when
the period is past and can be viewed in
retrospect. Sub-consciousness, wiser than the
surface brain, penetrates to the inner sanctuary
of true values, photographs something
typical of war's many aspects, places the
negative in the dark room of memory, and
fades into inertia until again called upon to
act as arbiter of significance for everyday
instinct. Not till long later, when released
from the tension of danger and abnormal
endeavour, is one's mind free to develop the
negative and produce a clear photograph.
The sensitive freshness of the print then obtained
is likely to last a lifetime. I leave
a detailed explanation of this process to the
comic people who claim acquaintance with
the psychology of the immortal soul; for my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>part, I am content to remain a collector of
such mental photographs.</p>

<p>A few examples of the sub-conscious impressions
gathered during my last year's term
at the Front are the curious smile of a dead
observer as we lifted his body from a bullet-plugged
machine; the shrieking of the wires
whenever we dived on Hun aircraft; a tree
trunk falling on a howitzer; a line of narrow-nosed
buses, with heavy bombs fitted under
the lower planes, ready to leave for their
objective; the ghostliness of Ypres as we
hovered seven thousand feet above its ruins;
a certain riotous evening when eight of the
party of fourteen ate their last dinner on
earth; a severe reprimand delivered to me
by a meticulous colonel, after I returned
from a long reconnaissance that included four
air flights, for the crime of not having fastened
my collar before arrival on the aerodrome
at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; a broken Boche aeroplane
falling in two segments at a height of ten
thousand feet; the breathless moments at a
Base hospital when the surgeon-in-charge examined
new casualties to decide which of
them were to be sent across the Channel;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>and clearest of all, the brown-faced infantry
marching back to the trenches from our village.</p>

<p>A muddy, unkempt battalion would arrive
in search of rest and recuperation. It distributed
itself among houses, cottages, and
barns, while the Frenchwomen looked sweet
or sour according to their diverse tempers,
and whether they kept estaminets, sold farm
produce, had husbands <i>l&agrave;bas</i>, or merely feared
for their poultry and the cleanliness of their
homes. Next day the exhausted men would
reappear as beaux sabreurs with bright buttons,
clean if discoloured tunics, and a jaunty,
untired walk. The drum and fife band practised
in the tiny square before an enthusiastic
audience of gamins. Late every afternoon
the aerodrome was certain to be crowded by
inquisitive Tommies, whose peculiar joy it
was to watch a homing party land and examine
the machines for bullet marks. The
officers made overtures on the subject of joy-rides,
or discussed transfers to the Flying
Corps. Interchange of mess courtesies took
place, attended by a brisk business in yarns
and a mutual appreciation of the work done
by R.F.C. and infantry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Then, one fine day, the drum and fife
rhythm of "A Long, Long Trail" would
draw us to the roadside, while our friends
marched away to Mouquet Farm, or Beaumont
Hamel, or Hohenzollern Redoubt, or
some other point of the changing front that
the Hun was about to lose. And as they left,
the men were mostly silent; though they
looked debonair enough with their swinging
quickstep and easy carriage, and their frying-pan
hats set at all sorts of rakish angles.
Their officers would nod, glance enviously at
the apple-trees and tents in our pleasant
little orchard, and pass on to the front of
the Front, and all that this implied in the
way of mud, vermin, sudden death, suspense,
and damnable discomfort. And returning
to the orchard we offered selfish
thanks to Providence in that we were not as
the millions who hold and take trenches.</p>

<p>The flying officer in France has, indeed,
matter for self-congratulation when compared
with the infantry officer, as any one
who has served in both capacities will bear
witness. Flying over enemy country is admittedly
a strain, but each separate job only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>lasts from two to four hours. The infantryman
in the front line is trailed by risk for
the greater part of twenty-four hours daily.
His work done, the airman returns to fixed
quarters, good messing, a bath, plenty of
leisure, and a real bed. The infantry officer
lives mostly on army rations, and as often
as not he sleeps in his muddy clothes, amid
the noise of war, after a long shift crammed
with uncongenial duties. As regards actual
fighting the airman again has the advantage.
For those with a suitable temperament there
is tense joy in an air scrap; there is none in
trudging along a mile of narrow communication
trench, and then, arrived at one's unlovely
destination, being perpetually ennuied
by crumps and other devilries. And in the
game of poker played with life, death, and
the will to destroy, the airman has but to
reckon with two marked cards&mdash;the Ace of
Clubs, representing Boche aircraft, and the
Knave Archibald; whereas, when the infantryman
stakes his existence, he must remember
that each sleeve of the old cheat Death
contains half a dozen cards.</p>

<p>All this by way of prelude to a protest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>against the exaggerative ecstasies indulged in
by many civilians when discussing the air
services. The British pilots are competent
and daring, but they would be the last to
claim an undue share of war's glory. Many
of them deserve the highest praise; but then
so do many in all other fighting branches of
Army and Navy. An example of what I
mean is the reference to R.F.C. officers, during
a Parliamentary debate, as "the super-heroes
of the war,"&mdash;a term which, for
ungainly absurdity, would be hard to beat.
To those who perpetrate such far-fetched
phrases I would humbly say: "Good gentlemen,
we are proud to have won your approval,
but for the Lord's sake don't make
us ridiculous in the eyes of other soldiers."</p>

<p>Yet another asset of the airman is that
his work provides plenty of scope for the
individual, who in most sections of the Army
is held on the leash of system and co-operation.
The war pilot, though subject to the
exigencies of formation flying, can attack and
man&oelig;uvre as he pleases. Most of the star
performers are individualists who concentrate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>on whatever methods of destroying an
enemy best suit them.</p>

<p>Albert Ball, probably the most brilliant air
fighter of the war, was the individualist <i>in
excelsis</i>. His deeds were the outcome partly
of pluck&mdash;certainly not of luck&mdash;but mostly
of thought, insight, experiment, and constant
practice. His knowledge of how to use sun,
wind, and clouds, coupled with an instinct
for the "blind side" of whatever Hun machine
he had in view, made him a master in
the art of approaching unobserved. Arrived
at close quarters, he usually took up his
favourite position under the German's tail
before opening fire. His experience then
taught him to anticipate any move that an
unprepared enemy might make, and his
quick wits how to take advantage of it.
Last autumn, whenever the weather kept
scout machines from their patrols but was
not too bad for joy-flying, he would fly near
the aerodrome and practise his pet man&oelig;uvres
for hours at a time. In the early days of
Ball's dazzling exploits his patrol leader once
complained, after an uneventful trip, that he
left the formation immediately it crossed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>lines, and stayed away until the return journey.
Ball's explanation was that throughout
the show he remained less than two hundred
feet below the leader's machine, "practising
concealment."</p>

<p>The outstanding pilots of my old squadron
were all individualists in attack, and it was
one of my hobbies to contrast their tactics.
C., with his blind fatalism and utter disregard
of risk, would dive a machine among
any number of Huns, so that he usually
opened a fight with an advantage of startling
audacity. S., another very successful leader,
worked more in co-operation with the machines
behind him, and took care to give his
observer every chance for effective fire. His
close watch on the remainder of the formation
saved many a machine in difficulties
from disaster. V., my pilot and flight-commander,
was given to a quick dive at the
enemy, a swerve aside, a recul pour mieux
sauter, a vertical turn or two, and another
dash to close grips from an unexpected direction,
while I guarded the tail-end.</p>

<p>But writing reminiscences of Umpty Squadron's
early days is a melancholy business.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>When it was first formed all the pilots were
picked men, for the machines were the best
British two-seaters then in existence, and
their work throughout the autumn push was
to be more dangerous than that of any
squadron along the British front. The price
we paid was that nine weeks from our arrival
on the Somme only nine of the original thirty-six
pilots and observers remained. Twelve
officers flew to France with the flight to which
I belonged. Six weeks after their first job
over the lines I was one of the only two
survivors. Three of the twenty-five who
dropped out returned to England with wounds
or other disabilities; the rest, closely followed
by twenty of those who replaced them, went
to Valhalla, which is half-way to heaven; or
to Karlsruhe, which is between hell and Freiburg-im-Brisgau.</p>

<p>And the reward? One day, in a letter
written by a captured Boche airman, was
found the sentence: "The most-to-be-feared
of British machines is the S&mdash;&mdash;." The umptieth
squadron then had the only machines
of this type in France.</p>

<p>During the short period of their stay with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>us, the crowd of boys thus rudely snatched
away were the gayest company imaginable;
and, indeed, they were boys in everything
but achievement. As a patriarch of twenty-four
I had two more years to my discredit
than the next oldest among the twelve members
of our flight-mess. The youngest was
seventeen and a half. Our Squadron Commander,
one of the finest men I have met in
or out of the army, became a lieutenant-colonel
at twenty-five. Even he was not
spared, being killed in a flying accident some
months later.</p>

<p>Though we were all such good friends, the
high percentage of machines "missing" from
our hangars made us take the abnormal
casualties almost as a matter of course at
the time. One said a few words in praise of
the latest to go, and passed on to the next
job. Not till the survivors returned home
did they have time, away from the stress of
war, to feel keen sorrow for the brave and
jolly company. For some strange reason, my
own hurt at the loss was toned down by a
mental farewell to each of the fallen, in
words borrowed from the song sung by an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>old-time maker of ballads when youth left
him: "Adieu, la tr&egrave;s gente compagne."</p>

<p>The crowded months of the umptieth
squadron from June to November were
worth while for the pilots who survived.
The only two of our then flight-commanders
still on the active list are now commanding
squadrons, while all the subaltern pilots have
become flight-commanders. The observers,
members of a tribe akin to Kipling's Sergeant
Whatsisname, are as they were in the matter
of rank, needless to say.</p>

<p>For my part, on reaching Blighty by the
grace of God and an injured knee, I decided
that if my unworthy neck were doomed to
be broken, I would rather break it myself
than let some one else have the responsibility.
It is as a pilot, therefore, that I am about to
serve another sentence overseas. A renewal
of Archie's acquaintance is hardly an inviting
prospect, but with a vivid recollection of
great days with the old umptieth squadron, I
shall not be altogether sorry to leave the
hierarchy of home instructordom for the good-fellowship
of active service. In a few months'
time, after a further period of aerial outings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>I hope to fill some more pages of Blackwood,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
subject always to the sanction of their editor,
the bon Dieu, and the mauvais diable who
will act as censor. Meanwhile, I will try to
sketch the daily round of the squadron in
which I am proud to have been an observer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Quarter to five, sir, and a fine morning.
You're wanted on the aerodrome at a quarter
past."</p>

<p>I sit up. A shiver, and a return beneath
the blankets for five minutes' rumination.
Dressing will be dashed unpleasant in the
cold of dawn. The canvas is wet with the
night's rain. The reconnaissance is a long
one, and will take fully three hours. The
air at 10,000 feet will bite hard. Must send
a field post-card before we start. Not too
much time, so out and on with your clothes.
Life is wrotten.</p>

<p>While dressing we analyse the weather,
that pivot of our day-to-day existence. On
the weather depends our work and leisure,
our comparative risks and comparative safety.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>Last thing at night, first thing in the morning,
and throughout the day we search the
sky for a sign. And I cannot deny that on
occasions a sea of low clouds, making impossible
the next job, is a pleasant sight.</p>

<p>The pale rose of sunrise is smudging over
the last flickerings of the grey night. Only a
few wisps of cloud are about, and they are
too high to bother us. The wind is slight
and from the east, for which many thanks, as
it will make easier the return half of the circuit.</p>

<p>We wrap ourselves in flying kit and cross
the road to the aerodrome. There the band
of leather-coated officers shiver while discussing
their respective places in the formation.
A bus lands and taxies to a shed.
From it descends the Squadron Commander,
who, with gum-boots and a warm coat over
his pyjamas, has been "trying the air." "Get
into your machines," he calls. As we obey
he enters his hut-office and phones the wing
headquarters.</p>

<p>The major reappears, and the command
"Start up!" is passed along the line of machines.
Ten minutes later we head for the
trenches, climbing as we travel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>It was cold on the ground. It was bitter
at 5000 feet. It is damnable at 10,000 feet.
I lean over the side to look at Arras, but
draw back quickly as the frozen hand of the
atmosphere slaps my face. My gloved hands
grow numb, then ache profoundly when the
warm blood brings back their power to feel.
I test my gun, and the trigger-pressure is
painful. Life is worse than rotten, it is
beastly.</p>

<p>But the cold soon does its worst, and a
healthy circulation expels the numbness from
my fingers. Besides, once we are beyond the
lines, the work on hand allows small opportunity
to waste time on physical sensations.
On this trip there is little interruption, thank
goodness. Archie falls short of his average
shooting, and we are able to outpace a group
of some twelve Hun two-seaters that try to
intercept us. The movement below is noted,
the round is completed according to programme,
and we turn westward and homeward.</p>

<p>Have you ever sucked bull's-eyes, respected
sir or madame? If not, take it from me that
the best time to try them is towards the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>of a three-hour flight over enemy country.
Five bull's-eyes are then far more enjoyable
than a five-course meal at the Grand Babylon
Hotel. One of these striped vulgarities
both soothes and warms me as we re-cross
the trenches.</p>

<p>Down go the noses of our craft, and we
lose height as the leader, with an uneven,
tree-bordered road as guide, makes for Doulens.
From this town our aerodrome shows
up plainly towards the south-west. Soon
we shall be in the mess marquee, behind us
a completed job, before us a hot breakfast.
Life is good.</p>

<p>Arrived on land we are met by mechanics,
each of whom asks anxiously if his particular
bus or engine has behaved well. The observers
write their reports, which I take to
the Brass Hats at headquarters. This done,
I enter the orchard, splash about in a canvas
bath, and so to a contented breakfast.</p>

<p>Next you will find most of the squadron
officers at the aerodrome, seated in deck-chairs
and warmed by an early autumn sun.
It is the most important moment of the day&mdash;the
post has just arrived. All letters <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>except
the one from His Majesty's impatient
Surveyor of Taxes, who threatens to take
proceedings "in the district in which you
reside," are read and re-read, from "My
dearest Bill" to "Yours as ever." Every
scrap of news from home has tremendous
value. Winkle, the dinky Persian with a
penchant for night life, has presented the
family with five kittens. Splendid! Lady
X., who is, you know, the bosom friend of a
certain Minister's wife, says the war will be
over by next summer at the <i>latest</i>. Splendid
again! Life is better than good, it is amusing.</p>

<p>Yesterday's London papers have been delivered
with the letters. These also are devoured,
from light leaders on electoral reform
to the serious legends underneath photographs
of the Lady Helen Toutechose, Mrs.
Alexander Innit, and Miss Margot Rheingold
as part-time nurses, canteeners, munitioners,
flag-sellers, charity matinee programme sellers,
tableaux vivants, and patronesses of the undying
arts. Before turning to the latest
number of the 'Aeroplane,' our own particular
weekly, one wonders idly how the
Lady Helen Toutechose and her emulators,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>amid their strenuous quick-change war-work,
find time to be photographed so constantly,
assiduously, and distractingly.</p>

<p>We pocket our correspondence and tackle
the morning's work. Each pilot makes sure
that his machine is overhauled, and if necessary,
he runs the engine or puts a re-rigged
bus through its paces. I am told off to
instruct half a dozen officers newly arrived
from the trenches on how to become a reliable
reconnaissance observer in one week.
Several of us perform mysteriously in the
workshops, for we are a squadron of many
inventors.</p>

<p>Every other officer has a pet mechanical
originality. Marmaduke is preparing a small
gravity tank for his machine, to be used
when the pressure tank is ventilated by a
bullet. The Tripehound has a scheme whereby
all the control wires can be duplicated.
Some one else has produced the latest thing
in connections between the pilot's joystick
and the Vickers gun. I am making a spade-grip
trigger for the Lewis gun, so that the
observer can always have one hand free to
manipulate the movable back-sight. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>one of these deathless inventions is completed
the real hard work begins. The new
gadget is adopted unanimously by the inventor
himself, but he has a tremendous task
in making the rest of the squadron see its
merits.</p>

<p>After lunch we scribble letters, for the
post leaves at five. As we write the peaceful
afternoon is disturbed by the roar of five
engines. B Flight is starting up in readiness
for an offensive patrol. Ten minutes
later more engines break into song, as three
machines of C Flight leave to photograph
some new lines of defence before Bapaume.
The overhead hum dies away, and I allow
myself a sleep in payment of the early morning
reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Wearing a dress suit I am seated on the
steps of a church. On my knee is a Lewis
gun. An old gentleman, very respectable in
dark spats, a black tie, and shiny top-hat,
looks down at me reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Very sad," he murmurs.</p>

<p>"Don't you think this trigger's a damned
good idea?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Young man, this is an outrage. As you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>are not ashamed enough to leave the churchyard
of your own accord, I shall have you
turned out."</p>

<p>I laugh and proceed to pass some wire
through the pistol-grip. The old man disappears,
but he returns with three grave-diggers,
who brandish their spades in terrifying
manner. "Ha!" I think, "I must fly
away." I fly my wings (did I tell you I had
wings?) and rise above the church tower.
Archie has evidently opened fire, for I hear
a near-by <i>wouff</i>. I try to dodge, but it is
too late. A shell fragment strikes my nose.
Much to my surprise I find I can open my
eyes. My nose is sore, one side of the tent
waves gently, and a small apple reposes on
my chest.</p>

<p>Having run into the open I discover that
the disengaged members of C Flight are
raiding our corner with the sour little apples
of the orchard. We collect ammunition from
a tree and drive off the attackers. A diversion
is created by the return of the three
photography machines. We troop across to
meet them.</p>

<p>The next scene is the aerodrome once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>again. We sit in a group and censor letters.
The countryside is quiet, the sun radiates
cheerfulness, and the war seems very remote.
But the mechanics of B Flight stand
outside their sheds and look east. It is time
the offensive patrol party were back.</p>

<p>"There they are," says a watcher. Three
far-away specks grow larger and larger. As
they draw near, we are able to recognise
them as our buses, by the position of their
struts and the distinctive drone of their engines.</p>

<p>Four machines crossed the lines on the
expedition; where is the fourth? The crew
of the other three do not know. They last
saw the missing craft ten miles behind the
Boche trenches, where it turned west after
sending up a Very's light to signal the necessity
of an immediate return. There were no
Huns in sight, so the cause must have been
engine trouble.</p>

<p>The shadows of the lost pilot and observer
darken the first ten minutes at the dinner-table.
However, since cheerfulness is beyond
godliness, we will take this to be an anxious
occasion with a happy ending. Comes a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>welcome message from the orderly officer,
saying that the pilot has phoned. His reason
for leaving the patrol was that his engine
went dud. Later it petered out altogether,
so that he was forced to glide down and
land near a battery of our howitzers.</p>

<p>The conversational atmosphere now lightens.
Some people from another squadron are our
guests, and with them we exchange the latest
flying gossip. The other day, X rammed
a machine after his gun had jambed. Y has
been given the Military Cross. Archie has
sent west two machines of the eleventeenth
squadron. While on his way home, with no
more ammunition, Z was attacked by a fast
scout. He grabbed a Very's pistol and fired
at the Boche a succession of lights, red,
white, and green. The Boche, taking the
rockets for a signal from a decoy machine,
or from some new form of British frightfulness,
promptly retired.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the usual crowd settle around
the card-table, and the gramophone churns
out the same old tunes. There is some dissension
between a man who likes music and
another who prefers rag-time. Number one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>leads off with the Peer Gynt Suite, and number
two counters with the record that choruses:
"Hello, how are you?" From the
babel of yarning emerges the voice of our
licensed liar&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I told the General he was the sort of
bloke who ate tripe and gargled with his
beer."</p>

<p>"Flush," calls a poker player.</p>

<p>"Give us a kiss, give us a kiss, by wireless,"
pleads the gramophone.</p>

<p>"Good-night, chaps. See you over Cambrai."
This from a departing guest.</p>

<p>Chorus&mdash;"Good-night, old bean."</p>

<p>A somewhat wild evening ends with a sing-song,
of which the star number is a ballad to
the tune of "Tarpaulin Jacket," handed down
from the pre-war days of the Flying Corps,
and beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The young aviator was dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as 'neath the wreckage he lay (he lay),<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>On turning in we give the sky a final
scour. It is non-committal on the subject of

<h2>I.</h2>

<h2>LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.</h2>
<br />

<p>... You have asked me, mon amie, to
tell you, from personal experience, all about
aeroplanes on active service. With the best
will in the world I can do no such thing, any
more than a medical student could tell you,
from personal experience, all about midwifery.</p>

<p>The Flying Corps has in France hundreds
of aeroplanes, scores of squadrons, and a
dozen varying duties. Earlier in the war,
when army aircraft were few and their function
belonged to the pioneer stage, every
pilot and observer dabbled in many things&mdash;reconnaissance,
artillery observation, bomb
raids, photography, and fighting. But the
service has since expanded so much, both in
size and importance, that each squadron is
made to specialise in one or two branches of
work, while other specialists look after the
remainder. The daily round of an artillery
squadron, for example, is very different from
the daily round of a reconnaissance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>squadron,
which is quite as different from that of
a scout squadron. Alors, my experience only
covers the duties of my own squadron. These
I will do my best to picture for you, but
please don't look upon my letters as dealing
with the Flying Corps as a whole.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will see better what I mean
if you know something of our organisation
and of the different kinds of machines.
There are slow, stable two-seaters that observe
around the lines; fighting two-seaters
that operate over an area extending some
thirty miles beyond the lines; faster fighting
two-seaters that spy upon enemy country
still farther afield; the bombing craft, single-seaters
or two-seaters used as single-seaters;
photography machines; and single-seater
scouts, quick-climbing and quick-man&oelig;uvring,
that protect and escort the observation
buses and pounce on enemy aeroplanes at
sight. All these confine themselves to their
specialised jobs, though their outgoings are
planned to fit the general scheme of aerial
tactics. The one diversion shared by every
type is scrapping the air Hun whenever possible&mdash;and
the ground Hun too for that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>matter, if he appear in the open and one
can dive at him.</p>

<p>Our organisation is much the same as
the organisation of the older&mdash;and junior&mdash;arms
of the Service (oh yes! the Gazette
gives us precedence over the Guards, the
Household Cavalry, and suchlike people).
Three or more squadrons are directed by a
wing-commander, whom one treats with deep
respect as he speeds a formation from the
aerodrome; a number of wings, with an aircraft
dep&ocirc;t, are directed by a brigadier, whom
one treats with still deeper respect when he
pays a visit of inspection; the whole is
directed by the General-Officer-Commanding-the-Flying-Corps-in-the-Field,
one-of-the-best,
who treats us like brothers.</p>

<p>We, in umpty squadron, are of the G.H.Q.
wing, our work being long reconnaissance and
offensive patrols over that part of the Somme
basin where bands of Hun aircraft rove thickest.
Our home is a wide aerodrome, flanked by
a village that comprises about thirty decrepit
cottages and a beautiful little old church.
Our tents are pitched in a pleasant orchard,
which is strewn with sour apples and field
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>kitchens. For the rest, we are a happy family,
and the sole blot on our arcadian existence
is the daily journey east to meet
Brother Boche and his hired bully Archibald.</p>

<p>After which explanatory stuff I will proceed
to what will interest you more,&mdash;the
excitements and tediousness of flights
over enemy country. Three hours ago I
returned from a patrol round Mossy-Face
Wood, where one seldom fails to meet black-crossed
birds of prey, so I will begin with the
subject of a hunt for the Flying Deutschman.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of fighting air patrol,
the defensive and the offensive, the pleasantly
exciting and the excitingly unpleasant.
The two species of patrol have of late kept
the great majority of German craft away
from our lines.</p>

<p>Airmen who look for trouble over enemy
country seldom fail to find it, for nothing
enrages the Boche more than the overhead
drone of allied aircraft. Here, then, are
some average happenings on an offensive
patrol, as I have known them.</p>

<p>We cross the lines at our maximum height,
for it is of great advantage to be above an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>enemy when attacking. Our high altitude is
also useful in that it makes us a small target
for Herr Archie, which is distinctly important,
as we are going to sit over him for the next
few hours.</p>

<p>Archie only takes a few seconds to make
up his mind about our height and range.
He is not far wrong either, as witness the
ugly black bursts slightly ahead, creeping
nearer and nearer. Now there are two bursts
uncomfortably close to the leader's machine,
and its pilot and observer hear that ominous
<i>wouff!</i> The pilot dips and swerves. Another
<i>wouff!</i> and he is watching a burst that might
have got him, had he kept a straight course.</p>

<p>Again the Archies try for the leader. This
time their shells are well away, in fact so
far back that they are near our bus. The
German battery notices this, and we are
forthwith bracketed in front and behind.
We swoop away in a second, and escape with
nothing worse than a violent stagger, and we
are thrown upward as a shell bursts close
underneath.</p>

<p>But we soon shake off the Archie group
immediately behind the lines. Freed from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>the immediate necessity of shell-dodging, the
flight-commander leads his covey around the
particular hostile preserve marked out for
his attention. Each pilot and each observer
twists his neck as if it were made of rubber,
looking above, below, and all around. Only
thus can one guard against surprise and yet
surprise strangers, and avoid being surprised
oneself. An airman new to active service
often finds difficulty in acquiring the necessary
intuitive vision which attracts his eyes
instinctively to hostile craft. If his machine
straggles, and he has not this sixth sense,
he will sometimes hear the rattle of a mysterious
machine-gun, or even the phut of a
bullet, before he sees the swift scout that has
swooped down from nowhere.</p>

<p>There is a moment of excitement when the
flight-commander spots three machines two
thousand feet below. Are they Huns? His
observer uses field-glasses, and sees black
crosses on the wings. The signal to attack
is fired, and we follow the leader into a steep
dive.</p>

<p>With nerves taut and every faculty concentrated
on getting near enough to shoot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>and then shooting quickly but calmly, we
have no time to analyse the sensations of
that dive. We may feel the tremendous
pressure hemming us in when we try to
lean over the side, but otherwise all we
realise is that the wind is whistling past the
strained wires, that our guns must be ready
for instant use, and that down below are
some enemies.</p>

<p>The flight-commander, his machine aimed
dead at the leading German, follows the
enemy trio down, down, as they apparently
seek to escape by going ever lower. He is
almost near enough for some shooting, when
the Huns dive steeply, with the evident intention
of landing on a near-by aerodrome. One
of them fires a light as he goes, and&mdash;enter the
villain Archibald to loud music. A ter-rap!</p>

<p>Our old friend Archie has been lying in
wait with guns set for a certain height, to
which his three decoy birds have led us.
There crashes a discord of shell-bursts as we
pull our machines out of the dive and swerve
away. The last machine to leave the unhealthy
patch of air is pursued for some
seconds by flaming rockets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>The patrol re-forms, and we climb to our
original height. One machine has left for
home, with part of a control wire dangling
helplessly beneath it, and a chunk of tail-plane
left as a tribute to Archie.</p>

<p>We complete the course and go over it
again, with nothing more exciting than further
anti-aircraft fire, a few Huns too low
for another dive, and a sick observer.</p>

<p>Even intrepid birdmen (war correspondentese
for flying officers) tire of trying to be
offensive on a patrol, and by now we are
varying our rubber-neck searchings with furtive
glances at the time, in the hopes that
the watch-hands may be in the home-to-roost
position. At length the leader heads
for the lines, and the lords of the air (more
war correspondentese) forget their high estate
and think of tea.</p>

<p>Not yet. Coming south towards Bapaume
is a beautiful flock of black-crossed birds.
As often happens, the German biplanes are
ranged one above the other, like the tiers
of a dress-circle.</p>

<p>Again the signal to attack, and the flight-commander
sweeps at what seems to be the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>highest enemy. We are ranging ourselves
round him, when two enemy scouts sweep
down from heaven-knows-where, firing as
they come. Several of their bullets enter
the engine of our rearmost rearguard. Finding
that the engine is on strike, the pilot
detaches his machine from the confusion and
glides across the lines, which are quite close.</p>

<p>For five minutes there is a medley of swift
darts, dives, and cart-wheel turns, amid the
continuous <i>ta-ta-ta-ta-ta</i> of machine-guns.
Then a German machine sways, staggers,
noses downward vertically, and rushes earthward,
spinning rhythmically. The other
Boches put their noses down and turn east.
We follow until we find it impossible to
catch them up, whereupon we make for
home.</p>

<p>The trenches are now passed, and our
aerodrome is quite near. The strained nerve-tension
snaps, the air seems intoxicatingly
light. Pilots and observers munch chocolate
contentedly or lift up their voices in songs of
Blighty. I tackle "The Right Side of Bond
Street," and think of pleasant places and
beings, such as Henley during regatta week,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>the Babylon Theatre, and your delightful
self.</p>

<p>We land, piece together our report, and
count the bullet-holes on the machine. In
ten minutes' time you will find us around
the mess-table, reconstructing the fight over
late afternoon tea. In the intervals of eating
cake I shall write you, and the gramophone
will be shrilling "Chalk Farm to Camberwell
Green."</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<h2>"ONE OF OUR MACHINES IS MISSING."</h2>

<p class="right" style="margin-right: 4em;">&mdash;<i>Official Report.</i></p>
<br />

<p>... Much may be read into the ambiguous
word "missing." Applied to a wife
or an actress's jewellery it can mean anything.
Applied to a man on active service
it can mean one of three things. He may
be dead, he may be a prisoner, he may be
wounded and a prisoner. If he be dead he
enters Valhalla. If he be a prisoner and a
wise man he enters a small cheque for the
German Red Cross, as being the quickest
way of letting his bankers and relations know
he is alive.</p>

<p>A missing aeroplane no longer exists, in
nine cases out of ten. Either it is lying in
pieces on enemy ground, smashed by an uncontrolled
fall, or it was burned by its former
tenants when they landed, after finding it
impossible to reach safety. Quite recently
my pilot and I nearly had to do this, but
were just able to glide across a small salient.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>I am thus qualified to describe a typical
series of incidents preceding the announcement,
"one of our machines is missing," and
I do so in the hope that this may interest
you, madam, as you flit from town to country,
country to town, and so to bed.</p>

<p>A group of British machines are carrying
out a long reconnaissance. So far nothing
has happened to divert the observers from
their notes and sketches, and a pilot congratulates
himself that he is on a joy-ride.
Next instant his sixth sense tells him there
is something in the air quite foreign to a
joy-ride. And there is. A thousand yards
ahead some eight to twelve machines have
appeared. The reconnaissance birds keep to
their course, but all eyes are strained towards
the newcomers. Within ten seconds
it is established that they are foes. The observers
put aside note-books and pencils, and
finger their machine-guns expectantly.</p>

<p>On come the Germans to dispute the
right of way. On go the British, not seeking
a fight, but fully prepared to force a
way through. Their job is to complete the
reconnaissance, and not to indulge in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>superfluous
air duels, but it will take a very great
deal to turn them from their path.</p>

<p>Now the aggressors are within 300 yards,
and firing opens. When the fight gets to
uncomfortably close quarters the Boches
move aside and follow the reconnaissance
party, waiting for an opportunity to surround
stragglers. Finally, some lucky shots
by a British observer cause one of them to
land in a damaged condition, whereupon the
rest retire. The British machines finish their
job and return with useful information.</p>

<p>But the party is no longer complete. The
pilot who thought of joy-rides was in the
rear machine, and the rear machine has disappeared.
Two Huns cut him off when the
rest began to follow the British formation.</p>

<p>His observer takes careful aim at the
nearest enemy, and rattles through a whole
drum as the German sweeps down and past,
until he is out of range. The pilot vertical-turns
the machine, and makes for the second
Boche. But this gentleman, refusing to continue
the fight alone, dives to join his companion.
The pair of them hover about for a
few minutes, and then disappear eastward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>The lonely pilot and observer look round
and take their bearings.</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" shouts the pilot
down the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>"Right away to the north; we are alone
in the wicked world." Thus the observer's
reply, handed across on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>Hoping to catch sight of the reconnaissance
party, my friend the pilot opens his
engine full out and begins to follow the
course that remained to be covered. For
ten minutes he continues the attempt to
catch up, but as the only aeroplanes to be
seen are coming up from an enemy aerodrome
he decides to get back alone as quickly
as possible. He turns due west.</p>

<p>The homing bird must fly in the teeth of
a strong west wind. It struggles along
gamely, and the pilot calculates that he may
reach the lines within twenty-five minutes.
But he has a queer feeling that trouble is
ahead, and, like his observer, he turns his
head around the horizon, so as not to be
caught unprepared.</p>

<p>All goes well for five minutes, except for
some nasty Archie shells. Then the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>men see a flock of aircraft at a great height,
coming from the north. Although black
crosses cannot be spotted at this range, the
shape and peculiar whiteness of the wings
make it probable that the strangers are
hostile. Possibly they are the very people
who attacked and followed the reconnaissance
formation.</p>

<p>Our pilot puts down the nose of his machine,
and races westward. The strangers,
making good use of their extra height, turn
south-west and try to head him off. They
gain quickly, and pilot and observer brace
themselves for a fight against odds.</p>

<p>The Germans are now about 700 feet
higher than my friends, and directly above
them. Four enemies dive, at an average
speed of 150 miles an hour, and from all
directions the Britishers hear the rattle of
machine-guns. The observer engages one
of the Huns, and evidently gets in some
good shooting, for it swerves away and lets
another take its place. Meanwhile enemy
bullets have crashed through two spars, shot
away a rudder-control, and ripped several
parts of the fuselage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>The black-crossed hawks cluster all around.
There are two on the left, one on the right,
one underneath the tail, and two above. A
seventh Hun sweeps past in front, about
eighty yards ahead. The pilot's gun rakes
it from stem to stern as it crosses, and he
gives a great shout as its petrol-tank begins
to blaze and the enemy craft flings itself
down, with a stream of smoke and another
flame shooting out behind.</p>

<p>But his own petrol-tank has been plugged
from the side, and his observer has a bullet
in the left arm. The petrol supply is regulated
by pressure, and, the pressure having
gone when German bullets opened the tank,
the engine gets less and less petrol, and
finally ceases work.</p>

<p>To glide fifteen miles to the lines is clearly
impossible. There is nothing for it but to
accept the inevitable and choose a good landing-ground.
The pilot pushes the joystick
slowly forward and prepares to land.</p>

<p>The Germans follow their prey down, ready
to destroy if by any chance its engine comes
back to life, and it stops losing height. The
observer tears up papers and maps, performs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>certain other duties whereby the enemy is
cheated of booty, and stuffs all personal possessions
into his pocket.</p>

<p>A medley of thoughts race across the observer's
mind as the pilot S-turns the machine
over the field he has chosen. A prisoner!&mdash;damnable
luck&mdash;all papers destroyed&mdash;arm
hurting&mdash;useless till end of war&mdash;how long
will it last?&mdash;chances of escape&mdash;relieve parents'
suspense&mdash;must write&mdash;due for leave&mdash;Marjorie&mdash;Piccadilly
in the sunshine&mdash;rotten
luck&mdash;was to be&mdash;make best of it&mdash;Kismet!</p>

<p>One duty remains. The observer digs into
the petrol tank as they touch earth, and then
runs round the machine. In a second the
petrol is ablaze and the fuselage and wings
are burning merrily. Germans rush up and
make vain attempts to put out the fire. Soon
nothing remains but charred debris, a discoloured
engine, bits of metal and twisted
wires.</p>

<p>My friends are seized, searched, and disarmed.
They then shake hands with the
German pilots, now heatedly discussing who
was chiefly responsible for their success. The
captive couple are lunched by the enemy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>airmen, who see that the wounded observer
receives proper attention. At the risk of
incensing some of your eat-'em-alive civilian
friends, I may say we have plenty of evidence
that the German Flying Corps includes
many gentlemen.</p>

<p>Later my friends are questioned, searched
again from head to toe, and packed off to
Germany. Just now they are affected with
deadly heart-sickness, due to the wearisome
inaction of confinement in a hostile land,
while we, their friends and brothers, continue
to play our tiny parts in Armageddon.</p>

<p>I enclose their names, and that of the
prison camp where they are lodged. Perhaps
you will find time to send them some
of your fast-dwindling luxuries, as you flit
from town to country, country to town, and
so to bed.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<h2>A BOMB RAID.</h2>
<br />

<p>... What are your feelings, dear lady,
as you watch the airships that pass in the
night and hear the explosion of their bombs?
At such a time the sensations of most people,
I imagine, are a mixture of deep interest,
deep anger, excitement, nervousness, and desire
for revenge. Certainly they do not include
speculation about the men who man
the raiders.</p>

<p>And for their part, the men who man the
raiders certainly do not speculate about you
and your state of mind. When back home,
some of them may wonder what feelings they
have inspired in the people below, but at the
time the job's the thing and nothing else
matters.</p>

<p>Out here we bomb only places of military
value, and do it mostly in the daytime, but
I should think our experiences must have
much in common with those of Zeppelin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>crews. I can assure you they are far more
strenuous than yours on the ground.</p>

<p>Our bombing machines in France visit all
sorts of places&mdash;forts, garrison towns, railway
junctions and railheads, bivouac grounds, staff
headquarters, factories, ammunition dep&ocirc;ts,
aerodromes, Zeppelin sheds, and naval harbours.
Some objectives are just behind the
lines, some are 100 miles away. There are
also free-lance exploits, as when a pilot with
some eggs to spare dives down to a low altitude
and drops them on a train or a column of
troops.</p>

<p>A daylight bomb raid is seldom a complete
failure, but the results are sometimes hard to
record. If an ammunition store blows up, or
a railway station bursts into flames, or a train
is swept off the rails and the lines cut, an airman
can see enough to know he has succeeded.
But if the bombs fall on something
that does not explode or catch fire, it is
almost impossible to note exactly what has
been hit. Even a fire is hard to locate while
one is running away from Archie and perhaps
a few flaming onions.</p>

<p>Fighting machines often accompany the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>bombing parties as escort. The fighters
guard the bombers until the eggs are dropped,
and seize any chances of a scrap on the way
back. It is only thus that I have played a
part in raids, for our squadron does not add
bombs to its other troubles. I will now tell
you, my very dear friend, about one such trip.</p>

<p>The morning is clear and filled with sunshine,
but a strong westerly wind is blowing.
This will increase our speed on the outward
journey, and so help to make the attack a
surprise. Those low-lying banks of thick
white clouds are also favourable to the factor
of surprise.</p>

<p>It is just before midday, and we are gathered
in a group near the machines, listening
to the flight-commander's final directions.
Punctually at noon the bombers leave the
ground, climb to the rendezvous height, and
arrange themselves in formation. The scout
machines constituting the escort proper follow,
and rise to a few hundred feet above
the bombers. The whole party circles round
the aerodrome until the signal strips for
"Carry on" are laid out on the ground, when
it heads for the lines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>At this point we, the fighting two-seaters,
start up and climb to our allotted height.
We are to follow the bombing party and act
as a rearguard until the eggs have fallen.
Afterwards, when the others have finished
their little bit and get home to their tea,
it will be our pleasant task to hang about
between the lines and the scene of the raid,
and deal with such infuriated Boche pilots
as may take the air with some idea of revenge.</p>

<p>We travel eastwards, keeping well in sight
of the bombers. The ridges of clouds become
more numerous, and only through gaps can
we see the trenches and other landmarks.
Archie, also, can only see through the gaps,
and, disconcerted by the low clouds, his performance
is not so good as usual. But for a
few shells, very wide of the mark, we are
not interrupted, for there are no German
craft in sight.</p>

<p>With the powerful wind behind us we are
soon over the objective, a large wood some
few miles behind the lines. The wood is
reported to be a favourite bivouac ground,
and it is surrounded by Boche aerodromes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Now the bombers drop below the clouds
to a height convenient for their job. As the
wood covers an area of several square miles
and almost any part of it may contain troops,
there is no need to descend far before taking
aim. Each pilot chooses a spot for his particular
attention, for preference somewhere
near the road that bisects the wood. He
aligns his sights on the target, releases the
bombs, and watches for signs of an interrupted
lunch below.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to tell the extent
of the damage, for the raid is directed not
against some definite object, but against an
area containing troops, guns, and stores. The
damage will be as much moral as material
since nothing unnerves war-weary men more
than to realise that they are never safe from
aircraft.</p>

<p>The guns get busy at once, for the wood
contains a nest of Archies. Ugly black bursts
surround the bombers, who swerve and zig-zag
as they run. When well away from the
wood they climb back to us through the
clouds.</p>

<p>We turn west and battle our way against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>the wind, now our foe. Half-way to the lines
we wave an envious good-bye to the bombers
and scouts, and begin our solitary patrol
above the clouds.</p>

<p>We cruise all round the compass, hunting
for Huns. Twice we see enemy machines
through rifts in the clouds, but each time we
dive towards them they refuse battle and
remain at a height of some thousand feet,
ready to drop even lower, if they can lure us
down through the barrage of A.-A. shells.
Nothing else of importance happens, and
things get monotonous. I look at my watch
and think it the slowest thing on earth,
slower than the leave train. The minute-hand
creeps round, and homing-time arrives.</p>

<p>We have one more flutter on the way to
the trenches. Two Huns come to sniff at
us, and we dive below the clouds once more.</p>

<p>But it is the old, old dodge of trying to
salt the bird's tail. The Hun decoys make
themselves scarce&mdash;and H.E. bursts make
themselves plentiful. Archie has got the
range of those clouds to a few feet, and,
since we are a little beneath them, he has
got our range too. We dodge with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>difficulty,
for Archie revels in a background of
low clouds. Nobody is hit, however, and
our party crosses the lines; and so home.</p>

<p>From the point of view of our fighting
machines, the afternoon has been uneventful.
Nevertheless, the job has been done, so much
so that the dwellers in the wood where we
left our cards are still regretting their disturbed
luncheon, while airmen and A.-A.
gunners around the wood tell each other
what they will do to the next lot of raiders.
We shall probably call on them again next
week, when I will let you know whether
their bloodthirsty intentions mature.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<h2>SPYING BY SNAPSHOT.</h2>
<br />

<p>... Since daybreak a great wind has
raged from the east, and even as I write
you, my best of friends, it whines past the
mess-tent. This, together with low clouds,
had kept aircraft inactive&mdash;a state of things
in which we had revelled for nearly a week,
owing to rain and mist.</p>

<p>However, towards late afternoon the clouds
were blown from the trench region, and artillery
machines snatched a few hours' work
from the fag-end of daylight. The wind was
too strong for offensive patrols or long reconnaissance,
so that we of Umpty Squadron did
not expect a call to flight.</p>

<p>But the powers that control our outgoings
and incomings thought otherwise. In view of
the morrow's operations they wanted urgently
a plan of some new defences on which the
Hun had been busy during the spell of dud
weather. They selected Umpty Squadron for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>the job, probably because the Sopwith would
be likely to complete it more quickly than
any other type, under the adverse conditions
and the time-limit set by the sinking sun.
The Squadron Commander detailed two buses&mdash;ours
and another.</p>

<p>As it was late, we had little leisure for
preparation; the cameras were brought in a
hurry from the photographic lorry, examined
hastily by the observers who were to use
them, and fitted into the conical recesses
through the fuselage floor. We rose from the
aerodrome within fifteen minutes of the deliverance
of flying orders.</p>

<p>Because of doubtful light the photographs
were to be taken from the comparatively low
altitude of 7000 feet. We were able, therefore,
to complete our climb while on the way
to Albert, after meeting the second machine
at 2000 feet.</p>

<p>All went well until we reached the neighbourhood
of Albert, but there we ran into a
thick ridge of cloud and became separated.
We dropped below into the clear air, and
hovered about in a search for the companion
bus. Five minutes brought no sign of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>whereabouts, so we continued alone towards
the trenches. Three minutes later, when
about one mile west of Pozi&egrave;res, we sighted,
some 900 yards to north of us, a solitary
machine that looked like a Sopwith, though
one could not be certain at such a range. If
it was indeed our second bus, its pilot, who
was new to France, must have misjudged
his bearings, for it nosed across to the German
air country and merged into the nothingness,
miles away from our objective. What
became of the lost craft is a mystery which
may be cleared up to-morrow, or more probably
in a month's time by communication
from the German Prisoners' Bureau, or maybe
never. Thus far we have heard nothing,
so a forced landing on British ground is unlikely.
For the rest, the pilot and observer
may be killed, wounded, injured, or prisoners.
All we know is that they flew into the Ewigkeit
and are "missing."</p>

<p>For these many weeks Pozi&egrave;res has been
but a name and a waste brick pile; yet the
site of the powdered village cannot be mistaken
from the air, for, slightly to the east,
two huge mine-craters sentinel it, left and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>right. From here to Le Sars, which straddles
the road four miles beyond, was our photographic
objective. We were to cover either
side of the road twice, so I had arranged to
use half the number of plates during each
there-and-back journey.</p>

<p>The R.F.C. camera used by us is so simple
as to be called foolproof. Eighteen plates
are stacked in a changing-box over the shutter.
You slide the loading handle forward
and backward, and the first plate falls into
position. Arrived over the spot to be spied
upon, you take careful sight and pull a string&mdash;and
the camera has reproduced whatever
is 9000 feet below it. Again you operate the
loading handle; the exposed plate is pushed
into an empty changing-box underneath an
extension, and plate the second falls into
readiness for exposure, while the indicator
shows 2. And so on until the changing-box
for bare plates is emptied and the changing-box
for used ones is filled. Whatever skill
attaches to the taking of aerial snapshots is in
judging when the machine is flying dead level
and above the exact objective, and in repeating
the process after a properly timed interval.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>A.-A. guns by the dozen hit out immediately
we crossed the lines, for we were
their one target. No other craft were in
sight, except a lone B.E., which was drifted
by the wind as it spotted for artillery from
the British side of the trenches. Scores of
black puffs, attended by cavernous coughs,
did their best to put the wind up us. They
succeeded to a certain extent, though not
enough to hinder the work on hand.</p>

<p>Everything was in Archie's favour. We
were at 7000 feet&mdash;an easy height for A.-A.
sighting&mdash;we were silhouetted against a cover
of high clouds, our ground speed was only
some thirty miles an hour against the raging
wind, and we dared not dodge the bursts,
however close, as area photography from anything
but an even line of flight is useless.
Yet, though the bursts kept us on edge, we
were not touched by so much as a splinter.
In this we were lucky under the conditions.
The luck could scarcely have held had the
job lasted much longer than a quarter of an
hour&mdash;which is a consoling thought when one
is safe back and writing to a dear friend in
England, not?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Northward, along the left-hand side of the
road, was my first subject; and a damned
unpleasant subject it was&mdash;a dirty-soiled,
shell-scarred wilderness. I looked overboard
to make certain of the map square, withdrew
back into the office, pulled the shutter-string,
and loaded the next plate for exposure.</p>

<p>"<i>Wouff!</i> <i>Ouff!</i> <i>Ouff!</i>" barked Archie,
many times and loud. An instinct to swerve
assaulted the pilot, but after a slight deviation
he controlled his impulse and held the
bus above the roadside. He had a difficult
task to maintain a level course. Whereas we
wanted to make east-north-east, the wind
was due east, so that it cut across and drifted
us in a transverse direction. To keep straight
it was necessary to steer crooked&mdash;that is to
say, head three-quarters into the wind to
counteract the drift, the line of flight thus
forming an angle of about 12&deg; with the longitudinal
axis of the aeroplane.</p>

<p>"<i>Wouff!</i> <i>ouff!</i>" Archibald continued, as I
counted in seconds the interval to the scene
of the next snapshot, which, as assurance
that the whole ground would be covered,
was to overlap slightly the first. A quick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>glance below, another tug at the string, and
plate the second was etched with information.
The third, fourth, and fifth followed;
and finally, to our great relief, we reach Le
Sars.</p>

<p>Here the pilot was able to dodge for a
few seconds while we turned to retrace the
course, this time along the southern edge of
the road. He side-slipped the bus, pulled it
around in an Immelmann turn, and then felt
the rudder-controls until we were in the required
direction. The interval between successive
exposures was now shorter, as the
east wind brought our ground speed to 120
miles an hour, even with the engine throttled
back. There was scarcely time to sight the
objective before the photograph must be
taken and the next plate loaded into place.
Within two minutes we were again over
Pozi&egrave;res.</p>

<p>V. took us across the lines, so as to deceive
the Archie merchants into a belief that
we were going home. We then climbed a
little, turned sharply, and began to repeat
our outward trip to north of the road.</p>

<p>Evidently Archie had allowed his leg to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>be pulled by the feint, and for two minutes
he only molested the machine with a few
wild shots. But soon he recovered his old
form, so that when we had reached Le Sars
the bus was again wreathed by black puffs.
We vertical-turned across the road and
headed for the trenches once more, with
the last few plates waiting for exposure.</p>

<p>Archie now seemed to treat the deliberation
of the solitary machine's movements
as a challenge to his ability, and he determined
to make us pay for our seeming contempt.
An ugly barrage of A.-A. shell-bursts
separated us from friendly air, the
discs of black smoke expanding as they
hung in little clusters. Into this barrier of
hate we went unwillingly, like children sent
to church as a duty.</p>

<p>Scores of staccato war-whoops reminded
us that the Boche gunners wanted our scalp.
I don't know how V. felt about it, but I
well know that I was in a state of acute
fear. Half-way to Pozi&egrave;res I abandoned
checking the ground by the map, and judged
the final photographs by counting the seconds
between each&mdash;"one, two, three, four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>(<i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i>)"; pull the string,
press forward the loading-handle, bring it
back; "one, two, three, four (<i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i>
<i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i>)," et-cetera. Just as the final
plate-number showed on the indicator a
mighty report from underneath startled us,
and the machine was pressed upward, left
wing down.</p>

<p>This was terrifying enough but not harmful,
for not one of the fragments from the
near burst touched us, strange to say. The
pilot righted the bus, and I made the last
exposure, without, I am afraid, caring what
patch of earth was shuttered on to the plate.</p>

<p>Nose down and engine full out, we hared
over the trenches. Archie's hate followed
for some distance, but to no purpose; and
at last we were at liberty to fly home, at
peace with the wind and the world. We
landed less than three-quarters of an hour
after we had left the aerodrome in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Good boys," said the Squadron Commander;
"now see that lightning is used in
developing your prints."</p>

<p>The camera was rushed to the photographic
lorry, the plates were unloaded in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>the dark hut, the negatives were developed.
Half an hour later I received the first proofs,
and, with them, some degree of disappointment.
Those covering the first outward and
return journey between Pozi&egrave;res and Le Sars
were good, as were the next three, at the
beginning of the second journey. Then came
a confused blur of superimposed ground-patterns,
and at the last five results blank
as the brain of a flapper. A jamb in the
upper changing-box had led to five exposures
on the one plate.</p>

<p>As you know, mon amie, I am a fool. But
I do not like to be reminded of the self-evident
fact. The photographic officer said I
must have made some silly mistake with the
loading handle, and he remarked sadly that
the camera was supposed to be foolproof. I
said he must have made some silly mistake
when inspecting the camera before it left his
workshop, and I remarked viciously that the
camera was foolproof against a careless operator,
but by no means foolproof against the
careless expert. There we left the subject
and the spoiled plates, as the evening was
too far advanced for the trip to be repeated.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>As the photoman has a pleasant job at wing
headquarters, whereas I am but an observer&mdash;that
is to say, an R.F.C. doormat&mdash;the
blame was laid on me as a matter of course.
However, the information supplied by the
successful exposures pleased the staff people
at whose instigation the deed was done, and
this was all that really mattered.</p>

<p>I have already told you that our main
work in umpty squadron is long reconnaissance
for G.H.Q. and offensive patrol. Special
photographic stunts such as happened
to-day are rare, thank the Lord. But our
cameras often prepare the way for a bombing
expedition. An observer returns from a
reconnaissance flight with snapshots of a
railhead, a busy factory, or an army headquarters.
Prints are sent to the "I" people,
who, at their leisure, map out in detail the
point of interest. No fear of doubtful reports
from the glossed surface of geometrical
reproduction, for the camera, our most trusted
spy, cannot distort the truth. Next a complete
plan of the chosen objective, with its
surroundings, is given to a bombing squadron;
and finally, the pilots concerned, well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>primed with knowledge of exactly where to
align their bomb-sights, fly off to destroy.</p>

<p>For the corps and army squadrons of the
R.F.C. photography has a prominent place
in the daily round. To them falls the duty of
providing survey-maps of the complete system
of enemy defences. Their all-seeing lenses
penetrate through camouflage to new trenches
and emplacements, while exposing fake fortifications.
The broken or unbroken German
line is fully revealed, even to such details as
the barbed wire in front and the approaches
in rear.</p>

<p>For clues to battery positions and the like,
the gun country behind the frontier of the
trenches is likewise searched by camera. One
day a certain square on the artillery map
seems lifeless. The following afternoon an
overhead snapshot reveals a new clump of
trees or a curious mark not to be found on
earlier photographs. On the third day the
mark has disappeared, or the trees are clustered
in a slightly different shape. But meanwhile
an exact position has been pin-pointed,
so that certain heavy guns busy themselves
with concentrated fire. By the fourth day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>the new gun-pits, or whatever it was that
the Hun tried to smuggle into place unnoticed,
have been demolished and is replaced
by a wide rash of shell-holes.</p>

<p>Wonderful indeed is the record of war as
preserved by prints in the archives of our
photographic section. For example, we were
shown last week a pair of striking snapshots
taken above Martinpuich, before and after
bombardment. The Before one pictured a
neat little village in compact perspective of
squares, rectangles, and triangles. The Aftermath
pictured a tangled heap of sprawling
chaos, as little like a village as is the usual
popular novel like literature.</p>

<p>Of all the Flying Corps photographs of
war, perhaps the most striking is that taken
before Ypres of the first Hun gas attack.
A B.E2.C., well behind the German lines,
caught sight of a strange snowball of a cloud
rolling across open ground, in the wake of an
east wind. It flew to investigate, and the
pilot photographed the phenomenon from the
rear. This reproduction of a tenuous mass
blown along the discoloured earth will show
coming generations how the Boche <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>introduced
to the black art of warfare its most
devilish form of frightfulness.</p>

<p>I would send you a few aerial photographs,
as you suggest, if the private possession of
them were not strictly verboten. Possibly
you will have an opportunity of seeing all you
want later, for if the authorities concerned are
wise they will form a public collection of a few
thousand representative snapshots, to show
the worlds of to-day, to-morrow, and the day
after what the camera did in the great war.
Such a permanent record would be of great
value to the military historian; and on a
rainy afternoon, when the more vapid of the
revues were not offering matin&eacute;es, they might
even be of interest to the average Londoner.</p>

<p>I can tell you little of the technical branch
of this new science, which has influenced so
largely the changing war of the past two
years, and which will play an even greater
part in the decisive war of the next two.
All I know is that hundreds of photos are
taken every day over enemy country, that
ninety per cent of them are successful, and
that the trained mechanics sometimes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>produce
finished prints twenty minutes after we
have given them our plates.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am not anxious to discuss the
subject further, for it is 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and at 5
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, unless my good angel sends bad weather,
I shall be starting for an offensive patrol over
Mossy-Face. Also you don't deserve even
this much, as I have received no correspondence,
books, or pork-pies from you for over a
week. In ten minutes' time I shall be employed
on the nightly slaughter of the spiders,
earwigs, and moths that plague my tent.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<h2>THE ARCHIBALD FAMILY.</h2>
<br />

<p>... You remark on the familiarity with
which I speak of Archie, and you ask for detailed
information about his character and
habits. Why should I not treat him with
familiarity? If a man calls on you nearly
every day you are entitled to use his Christian
name. And if the intimacy be such that at
each visit he tries to punch your head, he
becomes more a brother than a friend.</p>

<p>How, you continue, did a creature so strenuous
as the anti-aircraft gun come by the
flippant name of Archie? Well, once upon a
time the Boche A.-A. guns were very young
and had all the impetuous inaccuracy incident
to youth. British airmen scarcely knew
they were fired at until they saw the pretty,
white puffs in the distance.</p>

<p>One day a pilot noticed some far-away
bursts, presumably meant for him. He was
young enough to remember the good old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>days (you would doubtless call them the bad
old days) when the music-halls produced
hearty, if vulgar, humour, and he murmured
"Archibald, certainly not!" The name clung,
and as Archibald the A.-A. gun will go down
to posterity. You can take it or leave it;
any way, I cannot think of a better explanation
for the moment.</p>

<p>Archie has since grown up and become
sober, calculating, accurate, relentless, cunning,
and deadly mathematical. John or
Ernest would now fit him better, as being
more serious, or Wilhelm, as being more
frightful. For Archie is a true apostle of
frightfulness. There is no greater adept at
the gentle art of "putting the wind up"
people.</p>

<p>Few airmen get hardened to the villainous
noise of a loud <i>wouff!</i> <i>wouff!</i> at 12,000 feet,
especially when it is near enough to be followed
by the shriek of shell-fragments. Nothing
disconcerts a man more as he tries to
spy out the land, take photographs, direct
artillery fire, or take aim through a bombsight,
than to hear this noise and perhaps be
lifted a hundred feet or so when a shell bursts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>close underneath. And one is haunted by
the knowledge that, unlike the indirect fire
of the more precise guns, Archie keeps his
own eyes on the target and can observe all
swerves and dashes for safety.</p>

<p>To anybody who has seen a machine
broken up by a direct hit at some height
between 8,000 and 15,000 feet, Archie becomes
a prince among the demons of destruction.
Direct hits are fortunately few, but
hits by stray fragments are unfortunately
many. Yet, though the damage on such
occasions is regrettable, it is seldom overwhelming.
Given a skilful pilot and a well-rigged
bus, miracles can happen, though a
machine stands no technical chance of staggering
home. In the air uncommon escapes
are common enough.</p>

<p>On several occasions, after a direct hit, a
wounded British pilot has brought his craft
to safety, with wings and fuselage weirdly
ventilated and half the control wires helpless.
Archie wounded a pilot from our aerodrome
in the head and leg, and an opening
the size of a duck's egg was ripped into the
petrol tank facing him. The pressure went,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>and so did the engine-power. The lines were
too distant to be reached in a glide, so the
machine planed down towards Hun territory.
The pilot was growing weak from loss of
blood, but it occurred to him that if he stuck
his knee into the hole he might be able to
pump up pressure. He tried this, and the
engine came back to life 50 feet from the
ground. At this height he flew, in a semi-conscious
condition, twelve miles over enemy
country and crossed the lines with his bus
scarcely touched by the dozens of machine-guns
trained on it.</p>

<p>One of our pilots lost most of his rudder,
but managed to get back by juggling with
his elevator and ailerons. The fuselage of
my own machine was once set on fire by a
chunk of burning H.E. The flames died
out under pressure from gloves and hands,
just as they had touched the drums of ammunition
and all but eaten through a longeron.</p>

<p>Escapes from personal injuries have been
quite as strange. A piece of high explosive
hit a machine sideways, passed right through
the observer's cockpit, and grazed two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>kneecaps
belonging to a friend of mine. He was
left with nothing worse than two cuts and
mild shell-shock.</p>

<p>Scottie, another observer (now a prisoner,
poor chap), leaned forward to look at his
map while on a reconnaissance. A dainty
morsel from an Archie shell hurtled through
the air and grazed the back of his neck. He
finished the reconnaissance, made out his report,
and got the scratch dressed at the hospital.
Next day he resumed work; and he
was delighted to find himself in the Roll of
Honour, under the heading "Wounded." I
once heard him explain to a new observer
that when flying a close study of the map
was a guarantee against losing one's way,
one's head&mdash;and one's neck.</p>

<p>The Archibald family tree has several
branches. Whenever the founder of the
family went on the burst he broke out in
the form of white puffs, like those thrown
from the funnel of a liner when it begins to
slow down. The white bursts still seek us
out, but the modern Boche A.-A. gunner
specialises more in the black variety. The
white bursts contain shrapnel, which is cast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>outwards and upwards; the black ones contain
high explosive, which spreads all around.</p>

<p>H.E. has a lesser radius of solid frightfulness
than shrapnel, but if it does hit a machine
the damage is greater. For vocal
frightfulness the black beat the white hollow.
If the Titans ever had an epidemic of
whooping-cough, and a score of them chorused
the symptoms in unison, I should imagine
the noise was like the bursting of a black
Archie shell.</p>

<p>Then there is the green branch of the
family. This is something of a problem.
One theory is that the green bursts are for
ranging purposes only, another that they
contain a special brand of H.E., and a third
declares them to be gas shells. All three
suggestions may be partly true, for there is
certainly more than one brand of green
Archie.</p>

<p>First cousin to Archie is the onion, otherwise
the flaming rocket. It is fired in a
long stream of what look like short rectangles
of compressed flame at machines that
have been enticed down to a height of 4000
to 6000 feet. It is most impressive as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>firework display. There are also colourless
phosphorous rockets that describe a wide
parabola in their flight.</p>

<p>Within the past month or two we have
been entertained at rare intervals by the
family ghost. This fascinating and mysterious
being appears very suddenly in the
form of a pillar of white smoke, stretching
to a height of several thousand feet. It is
straight, and apparently rigid as far as the
top, where it sprays round into a knob.
Altogether, it suggests a giant piece of celery.
It does not seem to disperse; but if
you pass on and look away for a quarter of
an hour, you will find on your return that it
has faded away as suddenly as it came, after
the manner of ghosts. Whether the pillars
are intended to distribute gas is uncertain,
but it is a curious fact that on the few occasions
when we have seen them they have
appeared to windward of us.</p>

<p>Like babies and lunatics, Archie has his
good and bad days. If low clouds are about
and he can only see through the gaps he is
not very troublesome. Mist also helps to
keep him quiet. He breaks out badly when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>the sky is a cover of unbroken blue, though
the sun sometimes dazzles him, so that he
fires amok. From his point of view it is a
perfect day when a film of cloud about
20,000 feet above him screens the sky. The
high clouds forms a perfect background for
anything between it and the ground, and aircraft
stand out boldly, like the figures on a
Greek vase. On such a day we would willingly
change places with the gunners below.</p>

<p>For my part, Archie has given me a fellow-feeling
for the birds of the air. I have at
times tried light-heartedly to shoot partridges
and even pigeons, but if ever again
I fire at anything on the wing, sympathy
will spoil my aim.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<h2>BATTLES AND BULLETS.</h2>
<br />

<p>... I am not sure which is the more
disquieting, to be under fire in the air or on
the ground.</p>

<p>Although the airman is less likely to be
hit than the infantryman, he has to deal
with complications that could not arise on
solid earth. Like the infantryman, a pilot
may be killed outright by a questing bullet,
and there's an end of it. But in the case
of a wound he has a far worse time. If an
infantryman be plugged he knows he has
probably received "a Blighty one," and as
he is taken to the dressing-station he dreams
of spending next week-end in England. A
wounded pilot dare think of nothing but to
get back to safety with his machine, and possibly
an observer.</p>

<p>He may lose blood and be attacked by a
paralysing faintness. He must then make his
unwilling body continue to carry out the
commands of his unwilling brain, for if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>gives way to unconsciousness the machine,
freed from reasoned control, will perform
circus tricks and twist itself into a spinning
nose-dive. Even when he has brought the
bus to friendly country he must keep clear-headed;
otherwise he will be unable to exercise
the judgment necessary for landing.</p>

<p>Another unpleasant thought is that though
he himself escape unhurt, an incendiary bullet
may set his petrol tank ablaze, or some
stray shots may cut his most vital control
wires. And a headlong dive under these
conditions is rather too exciting, even for the
most confirmed seeker after sensation.</p>

<p>Yet with all these extra possibilities of
what a bullet may mean, the chances of
being plugged in the air are decidedly less
than on the ground. While travelling at
anything from 70 to 140 miles an hour it
is decidedly more difficult to hit another
object tearing along at a like speed and
swerving in all directions, than from a
machine-gun emplacement to rake a line of
men advancing "over the top." Another
point favourable to the airman is that he
scarcely realises the presence of bullets around
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>him, for the roar of his engine drowns that
sinister hiss which makes a man automatically
close his eyes and duck.</p>

<p>Given a certain temperament and a certain,
mood, an air fight is the greatest form
of sport on earth. Every atom of personality,
mental and physical, is conscripted into
the task. The brain must be instinctive with
insight into the enemy's moves, and with
plans to check and outwit him. The eye
must cover every direction and co-operate
with the brain in perfect judgments of time
and distance. Hands, fingers, and feet must
be instantaneous in seizing an opportunity to
swoop and fire, swerve and avoid, retire and
return.</p>

<p>In an isolated fight between two single
machines the primary aim of each pilot is
to attack by surprise at close quarters. If
this be impossible, he plays for position and
tries to get above his opponent. He opens
fire first if he can, as this may disconcert
the enemy, but he must be careful not to
waste ammunition at long range. A machine
with little ammunition is at a tremendous
disadvantage against a machine with plenty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>If an isolated British aeroplane sees a
formation of Germans crossing to our side
it has no hesitation in sweeping forward to
break up the party. You will remember
our old friend Marmaduke, dear lady? Only
last week he attacked ten German machines,
chased them back to their own place in the
air, and drove two down.</p>

<p>Even from the purely selfish point of view
much depends on the area. When an airman
destroys a Boche over German country
he may have no witnesses, in which case his
report is attended by an elusive shadow of
polite doubt. But if the deed be done near
the trenches, his success is seen by plenty
of people only too willing to support his
claim. Sometimes a pilot may even force a
damaged Boche machine to land among the
British. He then follows his captive down,
receives the surrender, and wonders if he
deserves the Military Cross or merely congratulations.</p>

<p>The tactics of an air battle on a larger
scale are much more complicated than those
for single combats. A pilot must be prepared
at every instant to change from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>offensive to the defensive and back again,
to take lightning decisions, and to extricate
himself from one part of the fight and sweep
away to another, if by so doing he can save
a friend or destroy an enemy.</p>

<p>To help you realise some of the experiences
of an air battle, my very dear madam, let
us suppose you have changed your sex and
surroundings, and are one of us, flying in
a bunch over the back of the German front,
seeking whom we may devour.</p>

<p>A moment ago the sky was clear of everything
but those dainty cloud-banks to the
east. Very suddenly a party of enemies appear
out of nowhere, and we rush to meet
them. Like the rest of us, you concentrate
your whole being on the part you must play,
and tune yourself up to the strain attendant
on the first shock of encounter. What happens
in the first few seconds often decides
the fight.</p>

<p>The opposing forces close up and perfect
their order of battle. The usual German
method, during the past few weeks, has been
to fly very high and range the machines one
above the other. If the higher craft are in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>trouble they dive and join the others. If
one of the lower ones be surrounded those
above can swoop down to its help. Our
own tactics vary according to circumstances.</p>

<p>At the start it is a case of follow-my-leader.
The flight-commander selects a Boche
and dives straight at him. You follow until
you are within range, then swerve away and
around, so as to attack from the side. Then,
with a clear field, you pour in a raking fire
by short bursts&mdash;<i>ta-ta-ta-ta</i>, <i>ta-ta-ta-ta-ta</i>, <i>ta-ta-ta-ta</i>,
aiming to hit the Boche pilot and
allowing for deflection. From all directions
you hear the rattle of other guns, muffled by
the louder noise of the engine.</p>

<p>A third British machine is under the
Boche's tail, and the observer in it is firing
upwards. The three of you draw nearer
and nearer to your prey. The Hun puts
his nose down to sweep away; but it is too
late. His petrol tank bursts into flames,
and the machine dives steeply, a streamer
of flame running away behind it. The fire
spreads to the fuselage and planes. After
rushing earthwards for two or three thousand
feet, the whole aeroplane crumbles up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>and you see the main portion falling like a
stone. And you (who have shed the skin
of sentiment and calm restraint and become
for the duration of the fight a bold bad pilot
with the lust of battle in your blood) are
filled with joy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, your observer's gun has been
grinding away behind you, showing that you
in your turn are attacked. You twist the
machine round. Almost instinctively your
feet push the rudder-control just sufficiently
to let you aim dead at the nearest enemy.
You press the trigger. Two shots are fired,
and&mdash;your gun jambs.</p>

<p>You bank and turn sideways, so as to let
your observer get in some shooting while
you examine your gun. From the position
of the check-lever you realise that there
has been a misfire. Quickly but calmly&mdash;feverish
haste might make a temporary
stoppage chronic&mdash;you lean over and remedy
the fault. Again you press the trigger, and
never was sound more welcome than the
<i>ta-ta-ta-ta-ta</i> which shows you are ready for
all comers.</p>

<p>Once more you turn to meet the attacking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Germans. As you do so your observer points
to a black-crossed bird which is gliding down
after he has crippled it. But three more are
closing round you. Something sings loudly a
yard away. You turn your head and see that
a landing wire has been shot through; and
you thank the gods that it was not a flying
wire.</p>

<p>The flight-commander and another companion
have just arrived to help you. They
dash at a Boche, and evidently some of their
shots reach him, for he also separates himself
and glides down. The two other Huns,
finding themselves outnumbered, retire.</p>

<p>All this while the two rear machines have
been having a bad time. They were surrounded
by five enemies at the very beginning
of the fight. One of the Boches
has since disappeared, but the other four
are very much there.</p>

<p>You sweep round and go to the rescue,
accompanied by the flight-commander and
the remaining British machine. Just as you
arrive old X's bus drops forward and down,
spinning as it goes. It falls slowly at first,
but seems to gather momentum; the spin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>becomes wilder and wilder, the drop faster
and faster.</p>

<p>"Poor old X," you think, "how damnable
to lose him. Now the poor beggar won't
get the leave he has been talking about for
the last two months." Then your thoughts
turn to Y, the observer in the lost machine.
You know his fianc&eacute;e, you remember he owes
you 30 francs from last night's game of
bridge.</p>

<p>You burn to avenge poor X and Y, but all
the Huns have dived and are now too low
for pursuit. You recover your place in the
formation and the fight ends as suddenly
as it began. One German machine has been
destroyed and two driven down, but&mdash;"one of
ours has failed to return."</p>

<p>When you return and land, you are not
so contented as usual to be back. There will
be two vacant places at dinner, and there
is a nasty job to be done. You will have to
write rather a painful letter to Y's fianc&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Madam, you are now at liberty to give up
the temporary role of a bold, bad pilot and
become once more your charming self.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h2>BACK IN BLIGHTY.</h2>
<br />

<p>... You last heard of my continued
existence, I believe, from a field post-card
with but one of the printed lines uncrossed:
"I have been admitted to hospital." When
this was sent I had no more expectation of
a return to Blighty than has a rich Bishop
of not entering the Kingdom of Heaven.
Nevertheless, here we are again, after a
three days' tour along the Red Cross lines
of communication.</p>

<p>Again I have been admitted to hospital.
This one is more sumptuous but less satisfying
than the casualty clearing station at
Gezaincourt, whence the card was posted.
There, in a small chateau converted into an
R.A.M.C. half-way house, one was not over-anxious
to be up and about, for that would
have meant a further dose of war at close
quarters. Here, in a huge military hospital
at Westminster, one is very anxious to be
up and about, for that would mean a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>long-delayed
taste of the joys of London. At
Gezaincourt rumbling gunfire punctuated the
countryside stillness; aeroplanes hummed past
on their way to the lines, and engendered
gratitude for a respite from encounters with
Archie; from the ward window I could see
the star-shells as they streaked up through
the dim night. At Westminster rumbling
buses punctuate the back-street stillness;
taxis hum past on their way to the West
End, and engender a longing for renewed
acquaintance with the normal world and the
normal devil; from the ward window I can
see the towers of Parliament as they stretch
up through the London greyness. For an
Englishman just returned from a foreign
battlefield to his own capital it should be an
inspiring view, that of the Home of Government,
wherein the Snowdens, Outhwaites,
Ponsonbys, and Sir Vested Interests, talk their
hardest for the winning of the war by one
side or the other, I am not sure which. But
somehow it isn't.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the hospital's position,
because it will help you on the day after to-morrow,
if the herewith forecast is correct.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>You will read this letter, hang me for my
customary disturbing suddenness, and search
a time-table. This will tell you that a train
from your part of the country arrives in town
at 11.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> (<i>e</i>), which bracketed letter
means Saturdays excepted. By it you will
travel on Tuesday morning. Then, in the
afternoon, you will seek a taxi, but either
the drivers will have as fares middle-aged
contractors, good for a fat tip, or they will
claim a lack of petrol, lady. You will therefore
fight for place in a bus, which must be
left at the corner of Whitehall and Queen
Victoria Street. Next you will walk towards
the river, past Westminster Abbey and the
Houses of Talk, and so to Chelsea Embankment.
Turn off by the Tate Gallery, enter
the large building on your right, and you
will have arrived. Visiting hours are from
two to four, but as the Sister is one of the
best and my very kind friend, you will not
be turned out until five.</p>

<p>But I can hear you ask leading questions.
No, I am not badly wounded nor seriously
ill. Neither am I suffering from shell-shock,
nor even from cold feet. A Blighty injury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>of the cushiest is the spring actuating this
Jack-in-the-Box appearance. Have patience.
To-day's inactivity has bred a pleasant boredom,
which I shall work off by writing you a
history of the reasons why I am back from
the big war. They include a Hun aeroplane,
a crash, a lobster, and two doctors.</p>

<p>You will remember how, months ago, our
machine landed on an abandoned trench,
after being damaged in a scrap? A bullet
through the petrol-pipe having put the carburettor
out of action, the engine ceased its
revs., so that we glided several miles, crossed
the then lines at a low height, and touched
earth among the network of last June's lines.
We pancaked on to the far edge of a trench,
and the wheels slid backward into the cavity,
causing the lower wings and fuselage to
be crumpled and broken.</p>

<p>My left knee, which has always been weak
since a far-back accident, was jerked by
contact with the parapet. Next day it
seemed none the worse, so I did not take the
accident seriously. During the weeks and
months that followed the knee was painless,
but it grew larger and larger for no <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>noticeable
reason, like Alice in Wonderland and the
daily cost of the war.</p>

<p>Then an aggressive lobster, eaten in Amiens
one fine evening, revenged itself by making
necessary a visit to the casualty clearing station
for attention to a mildly poisoned tummy.
The doctor who examined me noticed the
swollen knee, and looked grave. He pinched,
punched, and pressed it, and finally said:
"My dear boy, why the devil didn't you report
this? It's aggravated synovitis, and, if
you don't want permanent water-on-the-knee,
you'll have to lie up for at least three weeks.
I'll have you sent to the Base to-morrow."</p>

<p>My ambition did not yet soar beyond a
short rest at the Base. Meanwhile it was
pleasant to lie between real sheets and to
watch real English girls making beds, taking
temperatures, and looking after the newly
wounded with a blend of tenderness and
masterful competence. Their worst job appeared
to be fighting the Somme mud. The
casualties from the trench region were invariably
caked with dirt until the nurses had
bathed and cleaned them with comic tact
and great success.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>It being the day of an advance, scores of
cases were sent to Gezaincourt from the field
dressing stations. Each time an ambulance
car, loaded with broken and nerve-shattered
men, stopped by the hospital entrance, a
young donkey brayed joyously from a field
facing the doorway, as if to shout "Never
say die!" Most of the casualties echoed the
sentiment, for they seemed full of beans and
congratulated themselves and each other on
their luck in getting Blighty ones.</p>

<p>But it was otherwise with the cases of
shell-shock. I can imagine no more wretched
state of mind than that of a man whose
nerves have just been unbalanced by close
shaves from gun fire. There was in the same
lysol-scented ward as myself a New Zealander
in this condition. While he talked with a
friend a shell had burst within a few yards
of the pair, wounding him in the thigh and
sweeping off the friend's head. He lost much
blood and became a mental wreck. All day
and all night he tossed about in his bed,
miserably sleepless and acutely on edge, or
lay in a vacant and despondent quiet. Nothing
interested him, nothing comforted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>him&mdash;not
even a promise from the doctor of a long
rest in England.</p>

<p>There were also many victims of the prevailing
epidemics of trench-fever and rabid
influenza. The clearing station was thus
hard put to it to make room for all newcomers
by means of evacuation. For our
batch this happened next evening. A long
train drew up on the single-line railway near
the hospital, the stretcher cases were borne
to special Pullman cars, and the walking
cases followed, each docketed in his button-hole
by a card descriptive of wound or ailment.</p>

<p>You can have no idea of the comfort of
a modern R.A.M.C. train as used at the
Front. During the first few months of war,
when the small amount of available rolling
stock was worth its weight in man-power,
the general travel accommodation for the
wounded was the French railway truck, with
straw strewn over the floor. In these the
suffering sick were jolted, jerked, and halted
for hours at a time, while the scorching sun
danced through the van's open sides and
the mosquito-flies bit their damnedest. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>nowadays one travels in luxury and sleeping-berths,
with ever-ready nurses eager to wait
upon every whim.</p>

<p>A sling-armed Canadian was one of the
party of four in our compartment. Great
was his joy when a conjuring trick of coincidence
revealed that the jolly sister who
came to ask what we would like to drink
proved to be not only a Canadian, but actually
from his own little township in Manitoba.
While they discussed mutual friends
the rest of us felt highly disappointed that
we also were not from the township. As
evidence that they both were of the right
stuff, neither of them platitudinised: "It's a
small world, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The smooth-running train sped northward
from the Somme battlefield, and we betted
on each man's chances of being sent to
Blighty. Before settling down to sleep, we
likewise had a sweepstake on the Base of
destination, for not until arrival were we
told whether it was Rouen, Boulogne, or
Etaples. I drew Boulogne and won, as we
discovered on being awoken at early dawn
by a nurse, who arrived with tea, a cheery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>"Morning, boys," and bread-and-butter thin
as ever was poised between your slim fingers.</p>

<p>The wounded and shell-shocked New Zealander
had pegged out during the journey.
May the gods rest his troubled spirit!</p>

<p>From Boulogne station a fleet of ambulance
cars distributed the train's freight of
casualties among the various general hospitals.
At three of the starry morning I
found myself inside a large one-time hotel
on the sea front, being introduced to a bed
by a deft-handed nurse of unusual beauty.</p>

<p>The Blighty hopes of our party were realised
or disappointed at midday, when the
surgeon-in-charge came to decide which of
the new arrivals were to be forwarded across
Channel, and which were to be patched up
in France. The world stands still the moment
before the Ram Corps major, his examination
concluded, delivers the blessed
verdict: "Get him off by this afternoon's
boat, sister." Or an unwelcome reassurance:
"We'll soon get you right here."</p>

<p>For my part I had not the least expectation
of Blighty until the surgeon showed signs
of prolonged dissatisfaction with the swollen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>knee. Like the doctor at Gezaincourt, he
pinched, punched, and pressed it, asked for
its history, and finally pronounced: "I'm
afraid it'll have to be rested for about six
weeks." Then, after a pause: "Sorry we
haven't room to keep you here for so long.
You'll be fixed up on the other side." Hastily
I remarked that I should be sorry indeed
to take up valuable space at a Base hospital.
The major's departure from the ward was
the signal for a demonstration by the Blighty
squad. Pillows and congratulations were
thrown about, war-dances were performed
on game legs, the sister was bombarded with
inquiries about the next boat.</p>

<p>All places on the afternoon boat having
been booked, we were obliged to wait until
the morning. What a day! The last of a
long period amid the myriad ennuies of active
service, the herald of a long spell amid
the pleasant things of England. Impatience
for the morrow was kept bottled with difficulty;
every now and then the cork flew
out, resulting in a wild rag among those
able to run, walk, or hop. When the 'Times'
was delivered, it seemed quite a minor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>matter
that the Gazette should notify me that
I had been presented with another pip.</p>

<p>After dinner some one remarked that "she"
would soon come on duty, and there was an
air of conscious expectancy among the veterans
of the ward. "She," the V.A.D. girl
who had received us when we were deposited
at the hospital in the small hours of the
morning, was&mdash;and is&mdash;an efficient nurse, a
good comrade, a beautiful woman, and the
friend of every casualty lucky enough to have
been in her charge. For a wounded officer
staled by the brutalities of trench life there
could be no better mental tonic than the
ministrations and charm of Our Lady of X
Ward. I cannot guess the number and variety
of proposals made to her by patients of
a week's or a month's standing, but both
must be large. She is also the possessor of
this admirable and remarkable record. For
two years she has been nursing&mdash;really nursing&mdash;in
France, and yet, though she belongs
to a well-known family, her photograph has
never appeared in the illustrated papers that
boom war-work patriots. On this particular
evening, in the intervals of handing round
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>medicines and cheerfulness, our comrade the
night nurse made toffee for us over a gas-burner,
a grey-haired colonel and a baby subaltern
taking turns to stir the saucepan.</p>

<p>The next change of scene was to the quays
of Boulogne. Ambulance cars from the several
hospitals lined up before a ship side-marked
by giant Red Crosses. The stretcher
casualties were carried up the gangway, down
the stairs, and into the boat's wards below.
The remainder were made comfortable on
deck. Distribution of life-saving contraptions,
business with medical cards, gleeful
hoots from the funnel, chug-chug from the
paddles, and hey for Blighty! across a smooth
lake of a sea. Yarns of attack and bombardment
were interrupted by the pleasurable discovery
that Dover's cliffs were still white.</p>

<p>We seemed an unkempt crowd indeed by
contrast with dwellers on this side of the
Channel. The ragged raiment of men pipped
during a Somme advance did not harmonise
with plush first-class compartments of the
Chatham and Dover railway. Every uniform
in our carriage, except mine and another,
was muddied and bloodied, so that I felt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>almost
ashamed of the comparative cleanliness
allowed by life in an R.F.C. camp, miles behind
the lines. The subaltern opposite, however,
was immaculate as the fashion-plate of
a Sackville Street tailor. Yet, we thought, he
must have seen some tough times, for he
knew all about each phase of the Somme
operations. Beaumont Hamel? He explained
exactly how the Blankshires and Dashshires,
behind a dense barrage, converged up the
high ground fronting the stronghold. Stuff
Redoubt? He gave us a complete account
of its capture, loss, and recapture. But this
seasoned warrior quietened after the visit of
an official who listed us with particulars of
wounds, units, and service. His service overseas?
Five months in the Claims Department
at Amiens. Wound or sickness? Scabies.</p>

<p>Charing Cross, gateway of the beloved city!
The solid old clock looked down benignly as
if to say: "I am the first landmark of your
own London to greet you. Pass along through
that archway and greet the others."</p>

<p>But we could not pass along. The medical
watchdogs and mesdemoiselles the ambulance-drivers
saw to that. We were detailed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>cars and forwarded to the various destinations,
some to the provinces by way of another
station, some to suburban hospitals,
some to London proper. I was one of the
lucky last-named and soon found myself settled
in Westminster. Here the injured knee
was again pinched, punched, and pressed,
after which the ward surgeon told me I
should probably stay in bed for a month.
For exercise I shall be permitted to walk
along the passage each morning to the department
where they dispense massage and
ionisation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is midday and flying weather.
Over there a formation of A flight, Umpty
Squadron, will perhaps be droning back from
a hundred-mile reconnaissance. V., my mad
friend and sane pilot and flight-commander,
leads it; and in my place, alas! Charlie-the-good-guide
is making notes from the observer's
cockpit. The Tripehound and others
of the jolly company man the rear buses,
which number four or five, according to
whether the wicked bandit Missing has kidnapped
some member of the family. And
here loaf I, uncertain whether I am glad or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>sorry to be out of it. The devil of it is that,
unlike most of my bed-neighbours, I feel
enormously fit and am anxious to shake hands
with life and London. Time hangs heavy and
long, so bring all you can in the way of the
latest books, the latest scandals, and your
latest enthusiasms among the modern poets.
Above all, bring yourself.</p>
